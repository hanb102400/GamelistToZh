Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.

昆虫对手与蘑菇
所有敌方昆虫在攻击前都会发出独特的声音，这或许能帮助玩家识别是哪种昆虫在发动攻击。游戏中的敌人和物体如下：
1. 蜈蚣
蜈蚣会发起12波攻击。在第一波攻击中，蜈蚣由一个头部和11个身体节段组成。在第二波攻击中，蜈蚣除了一个与身体相连的头部和10个身体节段外，还会有一个分离的头部。第三波攻击中，蜈蚣有一个相连的头部、9个身体节段，外加两个分离的头部。这些身体节段会转化为头部，并持续如此，直到第12波。在最后一波攻击中，蜈蚣会有12个分离的头部，各自独立地攻击玩家。蜈蚣的头部比身体节段得分更高。
蜈蚣会从屏幕顶部向下发起攻击。如果火花击中蜈蚣的任何部位，该身体节段将变成一个蘑菇，而其后面的身体节段将成为新的蜈蚣头部。当蜈蚣被消灭后，它会短暂消失，然后再次从屏幕顶部出现。

蜘蛛
蜘蛛会试图分散玩家对蜈蚣的攻击注意力。它会摧毁它碰到的任何蘑菇。如果在较近的距离击中蜘蛛，得分会更高。

跳蚤
如果玩家摧毁了大部分现有的蘑菇，跳蚤就会出现。它会掉落并在落点处生成一批新的蘑菇。跳蚤被击中两次后会消失。第一次被击中后，跳蚤掉落的速度会快很多。

蝎子
蝎子会在第三波攻击中出现。它移动缓慢，但会逐渐加速，移动得越来越快。在此过程中，它会使它碰到的任何蘑菇中毒。

蘑菇
蘑菇遍布魔法森林，它们可以作为玩家的障碍物或掩护，同时对敌方昆虫有额外的影响。需要射击四次才能完全摧毁一个蘑菇。蘑菇有两种类型：魔法蘑菇和毒蘑菇。魔法蘑菇是游戏中的默认蘑菇，也是玩家消灭昆虫或蜈蚣身体节段的结果。毒蘑菇是蝎子触碰蘑菇后的产物。毒蘑菇会促使附近的蜈蚣直接穿过任何蘑菇向玩家移动。失去一根魔杖会修复任何部分受损的蘑菇。

游戏难度与模式
游戏提供四种难度级别：新手、标准、高级和专家。游戏模式如下：
1. 单人模式

双人交替模式

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.
Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, ""living"" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.
Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.","《大金刚》于1981年在街机上发布，它不仅是任天堂公司的第一款真正意义上的热门游戏，还标志着该公司两个最受欢迎的吉祥物的登场：马里奥（最初名为“跳跃人”）和大金刚。
《大金刚》是一款平台动作游戏，在游戏中，马里奥要攀爬四个不同工业主题的关卡（建筑工地、水泥厂、电梯主题关卡，以及从钢梁上拆除铆钉的关卡），试图在计时器归零之前，从这只大猩猩手中救出被困的少女宝琳。当最后一关的铆钉被拆除后，大金刚倒下，这对恋人得以重逢。此后，关卡将以更高的难度重新开始。
在游戏过程中，马里奥必须躲避源源不断的木桶、“活”火球和弹簧秤砣。虽然不像在其他后续游戏中那样强大，但马里奥可以找到一把锤子，在有限的时间内用它摧毁木桶和火球。此外，马里奥还可以找到宝琳的帽子、钱包和雨伞，以获得额外的奖励分数。
《大金刚》还因是最早以电子游戏形式呈现完整叙事的游戏之一而闻名，它通过简单的过场动画来推动故事发展。还需注意的是，在20世纪80年代早期游戏机版本的游戏中，《大金刚》通常只采用了原始关卡中的两到三个，水泥厂关卡通常会被省略。"

Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong.  In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.
Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.
Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.
In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.
Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.","马里奥绑架了小金刚的爸爸！
《小金刚》最初于1982年作为《大金刚》的续作在街机上发布。在这款游戏中，马里奥扮演反派角色，最终抓住了大金刚，并把这只猿猴关进了一个锁着的笼子里。作为小金刚，玩家必须通过四个不同的关卡（藤蔓关、弹簧板关、铁链关和马里奥的藏身之处），试图找到钥匙来解救小猴子的父亲。
一路上，马里奥将派出大嘴怪、俯冲而下的紫色小鸟和电火花，试图阻止小金刚。小金刚可以通过将关卡周围找到的水果砸向敌人的头部来进行自卫。在一次下落过程中，一块水果击中的敌人越多，获得的奖励分数就越高。
小金刚还可以一次抓住两条铁链或藤蔓，以更快地爬开，或者跳过敌人，从而更轻松地避开敌人。然而，任何长时间的坠落或在某些关卡掉进水里都意味着小金刚会失去一条命。
在最后的过场动画中，小金刚将解救大金刚，在踢了马里奥一脚后，两者都将逃脱。一旦所有四个关卡都通关，游戏将以更高的难度重新开始。

你的驾驶舱配备了美国空军提供的先进技术：显示屏和主计算机、敌机警报指示器、过载指示器、电子对抗措施以及机炮过热指示器（没错，机炮会过热！）……如果你有胆量，还能让这只“老鸟”加速到1.0马赫！
和其他模拟游戏一样，这款游戏的玩法包括起飞、飞行、战斗和降落。不过，大部分玩法都围绕着与敌机进行空战（躲避导弹）展开。此外，还有夜间飞行任务，由于视野受限，这些任务难度更高。
然而，起飞和降落也需要额外的技巧，因为你是在“企业”号航母（与《星际迷航》无关）上进行操作，而不是在普通的跑道上。起飞前要听从飞行甲板指挥官的指挥（因为在这方面他说了算……而且尽量别撞到他……暂时别）。
你的武器包括一挺M61机枪和3种不同的AIM导弹（AIM - 7、AIM - 9、AIM - 54），每种导弹各有15枚（这可不少导弹！）。
每次任务结束后，你会根据飞行技巧、击落敌机数量和发射武器数量获得一个任务评级。"

Call the plays, then run them using the keyboard or joystick.  Digitized voices enhance the game, including the crowd, calling the numbers, and referee's calls.",考虑到制作年份和当时的技术水平，这是一款相当出色的橄榄球模拟游戏。你可以安排战术，然后使用键盘或游戏手柄来执行。数字化语音效果提升了游戏体验，其中包括观众的呼喊声、战术编号播报以及裁判的判罚声。
46136ac1c3f2b9d70d4e4263a7cb96f7,Tower Toppler (Europe).zip,Tower Toppler,拆塔小子,"You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up. 
You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment. 
The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.
Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.","你扮演一个绿色小人，需要炸毁八座塔楼，因为这些塔楼的存在正在以某种方式污染那些有可能成为理想殖民地的星球的水源。不幸的是，你需要爬到这些塔楼的顶部才能将它们炸毁。
你通过塔楼外部的通道爬到塔顶。在登顶的过程中，你需要跳过、踢开各种敌人，并从它们身边跑开。大多数垂直移动是通过在合适的时机跳到移动的平台上来实现的。
这款游戏在当时因其图形技术而被认为具有革命性。当主角在塔楼外部走动时，角色固定在屏幕中央，而塔楼本身则在旋转。这产生了一种伪3D效果。
各座塔楼之间通过乘坐你可靠的MK.7潜艇在海上航行连接起来。这部分玩法类似横版收集游戏，你可以在其中获得额外积分。"

You control both the boat and skier in this vertically scrolling action game. Your goal is to reach the finish line before time runs out and also to earn as many points as possible. The river is quite dangerous, and features many twists and turns along with rocks, logs and other obstacles. For bonus points there are numerous ramps located throughout the river which your skier can jump over (and if you can manage to ski over every ramp on the level, you'll earn even more points!). You start the game with four skiers, and the game ends when all of you skiers have crashed.",在《滑水》中，你将在法罗纳河上进行滑水运动。在这款垂直滚动的动作游戏里，你可以同时操控船只和滑水者。你的目标是在时间耗尽前抵达终点线，同时尽可能多地赚取积分。这条河十分危险，有许多弯道，还有岩石、原木和其他障碍物。河上分布着众多坡道，滑水者可以从上面飞跃而过，这样就能获得额外积分（如果你能在这一关卡中滑过每一个坡道，还能获得更多积分！）。游戏开始时你有四名滑水者，当所有滑水者都摔倒时，游戏结束。

A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence.  A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos.
A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.
Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.","异形。这个名字让每个殖民者都心生恐惧。你收到了环绕母星运行的空间站发出的求救信号，随后便陷入了死寂。一艘飞船成功逃脱，驾驶它的是一名遍体鳞伤的男子，他讲述了那些孵化出会喷酸液异形的卵荚的故事。
一小队工程师已被派去对抗异形威胁，以免它们占领所有空间站，最终危及你的母星。组建你的工程师小队，在每个空间站与异形战斗，努力清除它们或者放弃该空间站。你一开始只有一把标准配备的激光枪，但在探索过程中可以找到其他武器，包括相位枪、闪电步枪、喷火器和炸弹。
《异形恐惧症》最初是巴利/米德韦公司于1987年推出的街机投币游戏。游戏的玩法设定和背景深受电影《异形2》的启发和影响。"

Our only defense is the prototype Solvalou Fighter Plane. With this plane we can fight the deadly Domogram Rovers; the Toroid Patrol Fleets and the Zoshi Death Squads. 
Xevious is a vertically scrolling shooter based on the 1982 coin-op of the same name. It was innovative in that it was the first vertically scrolling shooter to feature dual-level attacks; both ground and air.","人们发现，地球上真正的外星人其实是人类，无情的塞维恩星人（Xevions）想要夺回他们的星球，但不要我们人类。我们唯一的防御手段是原型索尔瓦洛战斗机（Solvalou Fighter Plane）。有了这架飞机，我们就能对抗致命的多米格拉姆漫游者（Domogram Rovers）、环形巡逻舰队（Toroid Patrol Fleets）和佐希敢死队（Zoshi Death Squads）。
《太空侵略者》是一款纵向卷轴射击游戏，其原型是1982年同名街机游戏。它的创新之处在于，它是第一款具备地面和空中双层面攻击的纵向卷轴射击游戏。"
