For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.
For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.","《动视十项全能》是一系列类似于 Epyx 游戏系列的奥运会游戏。最多四名玩家可以参加现实生活中十项全能的十个不同项目的比赛，可以按顺序进行，也可以单独进行。这些项目包括 100 米短跑、跳远、铅球、跳高、400 米赛跑、110 米跨栏、铁饼投掷、撑杆跳、标枪投掷和 1500 米赛跑。

在平地跑步项目中，需要简单地晃动操纵杆，同时必须准确把握按键时机以跨越栏架——撞到栏架或打乱步伐会导致失去动力，从而浪费时间。在跳跃和投掷项目中，你必须通过晃动操纵杆来积累动力，然后在你认为合适的时机按下按钮进行投掷或跳跃。

On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen.  The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics.
In games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft.  You are stationary.   Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile.  
In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above.  On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen.  Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above.  Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired.
 
In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again.  This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits).  The controls are as in games 1-6.  
In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above.  Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed.  When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired.  
In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below.  The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18.  The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below.  
In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.
Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds.  (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets.  I have yet to see this happen.)  In each of the single player games, the single player tries to outscore a computer opponent that simply constantly fires.","海空大战基本上是一款射击游戏。在大多数关卡中，你位于屏幕底部，向屏幕顶部的目标射击。不同的关卡提供不同的目标和具有不同特性的武器。

在第7 - 12关，你操控一艘潜艇，向上方的船只发射鱼雷。在这些关卡中，你可以让潜艇在屏幕底部来回移动。然而，你的鱼雷只能垂直向上发射。某些关卡允许在鱼雷发射后对其方向进行一些微调。
在第13 - 15关，显然你又操控起了高射炮。不过这次，你射击的目标是射击场里的靶子（小丑脸、鸭子、兔子）。操作方式与第1 - 6关相同。
在第16 - 18关，你操控一艘军舰，向上方飞行的喷气式飞机发射北极星导弹。你的军舰会自行持续移动，你只能控制其速度。当你发射导弹时，导弹的发射角度和速度取决于发射时军舰的行驶速度。某些关卡在导弹发射后会限制你改变速度的能力，而另一些关卡则允许你在导弹发射后通过改变速度来控制导弹。
在第19 - 21关，情况反过来了，你操控喷气式飞机，向下方的船只投下炸弹。此关卡的操作方式与第16 - 18关相同。当然，区别在于你是从上方朝下方的目标投下炸弹。
在第22 - 27关，一名玩家操控喷气式飞机，另一名玩家操控军舰。

0492eafe3f202aa2b90d329025f12f7e,AndroMan on the Moon (USA) (Proto).zip,Androman On The Moon,月球上的安德罗曼,"Androman on the Moon was one of several planned games for the unreleased Androman robot.  Although a few of the games were rumored to have been programmed, Androman on the Moon is the first one to actually surface.  Although the game itself may not look like much, one has to remember that it was only part of the package.  The real magic was with Androman himself. 
 
So what exactly was Androman?  Androman was a small white robot that would scurry about on a floor mat while the player controlled him using the Atari 2600.  Androman also had a barcode scanner in his bottom that would read barcodes placed on the map so the 2600 (and the robot) knew where he was.  Using a combination of the joystick and barcodes, the player could guide Androman around the floor mat and play various games.  One of those games being Androman on the Moon.  
 
So exactly what is Androman doing on the moon?  According to programmer Michael Case, Androman is mining minerals on the moon when he is attacked by aliens (don't you hate it when that happens?).  The giant floor mat would have the locations of the mines, and the player would have to guide Androman to them.  Once Androman was over a mine, the 2600 would show the mine maze portion of the game.  In the mine maze the player has to guide Androman (shown as an X) through the maze while avoiding the alien (shown as a green face).  
 
Androman on the Moon is an interesting game that shows how the 2600 could be expanded and enhanced through the use of sophisticated controllers (such as robots).  Unfortunately the game market was rapidly deteriorating, and the public wasn't very receptive to new ideas, especially anything that cost extra money.  The Androman idea wouldn't be seen again until Nintendo decided to try something similar with R.O.B.  Unfortunately R.O.B. met a similar fate after only two games.","《月球上的安德罗曼》是为未发布的安德罗曼机器人计划开发的几款游戏之一。尽管有传言称其中一些游戏已经完成编程，但《月球上的安德罗曼》是第一款真正浮出水面的游戏。虽然这款游戏本身看起来可能并不起眼，但人们必须记住，它只是整个套装的一部分。真正的魅力在于安德罗曼本身。

那么，安德罗曼究竟是什么呢？安德罗曼是一个白色的小型机器人，玩家可以使用雅达利2600游戏机控制它在一块地垫上四处移动。安德罗曼的底部还有一个条形码扫描器，可以读取放置在地图上的条形码，这样雅达利2600游戏机（以及机器人）就能知道它的位置。玩家通过结合使用操纵杆和条形码，就可以引导安德罗曼在地垫上移动并玩各种游戏。《月球上的安德罗曼》就是其中之一。

那么，安德罗曼在月球上究竟在做什么呢？据程序员迈克尔·凯斯称，安德罗曼正在月球上开采矿物时遭到了外星人的攻击（遇到这种事谁不讨厌呢？）。巨大的地垫上会标明矿场的位置，玩家必须引导安德罗曼前往这些矿场。一旦安德罗曼到达矿场上空，雅达利2600游戏机就会显示游戏中的矿场迷宫部分。在矿场迷宫中，玩家必须引导安德罗曼（显示为一个“X”）穿过迷宫，同时避开外星人（显示为一张绿色的脸）。

《月球上的安德罗曼》是一款有趣的游戏，它展示了如何通过使用复杂的控制器（如机器人）来扩展和增强雅达利2600游戏机的功能。不幸的是，当时游戏市场正在迅速衰退，公众对新创意并不十分接受，尤其是任何需要额外花钱的东西。直到任天堂决定用R.O.B.尝试类似的东西时，安德罗曼的创意才再次出现。不幸的是，R.O.B.在只推出两款游戏后也遭遇了类似的命运。"

Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For Atari, this is the variation used here:
All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the roll of the dice.
No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to the bar.
A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he wants, after making the 1-2 move.
After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.
If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2 and choose another doublet.

Testing showed that players frequently got headaches moving their eyebrows around to play the game. Though Atari could have tried to refine the device over time, Atari simply decided to shelve the Mindlink. Two games were in development for the Mindlink by its cancellation, Bionic Breakthrough & Mind Maze. 
 
Bionic Breakthrough was basically Breakout controlled with the Mindlink, while Mind Maze was an attempt to use ESP through the Mindlink to predict what is printed on cards, which admittedly didn't work.

In this game, you are a bubble named, with great originality, Bubble.
The object here is to bounce on each of the thirty-six squares and turn them all on. You start at the bottom left. On the bottom right starts the Bubble Eater. He will chase you around the play field and if he catches you, you lose one of your five lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If you are hit by Pin, you pop and a life is lost.
The good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that if it lands on the Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too. When the Bubble Eater is popped, it turns into a glowing puddle for a short time. While it is a puddle, you can bounce on it without getting hurt.
Game variations
The game select switch just lets you start on levels one, two or three.
Levels
There are 5 waves per level.
Level 1: The Bubble can bounce on any square and it will turn on and stay on.
Level 2: The same as level 1 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 3: The same as level 1 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.
Level 4: The Bubble can bounce on any square and turn it on, but if you bounce on it again it turns off then you must bounce on it once more to turn it on again.
Level 5: The same as level 4 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.
Level 6: The same as level 4 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.
Scoring
You get 300 points the first time a Bubble Eater is popped in a wave.
You score points each time you turn on a step. In levels 4 to 6, you get points even if you are turning on a step a repeatedly.
You get points for completing a level and/or wave. The amount varies by what level or wave you completed.","这是一款颇让人想起《奇宝方块》（Q*bert）的游戏。
在这款游戏中，你扮演一个名为“泡泡”（Bubble）的气泡，这名字相当有创意。
游戏目标是在三十六块方格的每一块上弹跳，并将它们全部点亮。你从左下角开始。右下角则是“泡泡吞噬者”（Bubble Eater）的起始位置。它会在游戏区域内追着你跑，要是被它抓住，你就会失去五条命当中的一条。“尖针”（Pin）从一排的顶部开始向下移动。要是你被尖针击中，泡泡就会破裂，同时失去一条命。
尖针的好处在于，除了它不会主动追你之外，要是它落到泡泡吞噬者身上，也会把它戳破。当泡泡吞噬者被戳破后，它会在短时间内变成一滩发光的水洼。在它变成水洼的时候，你可以在上面弹跳而不会受伤。
游戏变体
游戏选择开关能让你从第一、第二或第三关开始游戏。
关卡
每一关有五波。
第一关：泡泡可以在任何方格上弹跳，方格会被点亮并保持亮起状态。
第二关：和第一关相同，但在前往另一排之前，必须先点亮同一水平排的所有方格。
第三关：和第一关相同，但必须先点亮水平排的第 2、4、6 排，才能点亮第 1、3、5 排。
第四关：泡泡可以在任何方格上弹跳并将其点亮，但要是你再次在同一个方格上弹跳，它就会熄灭，之后你必须再弹跳一次才能再次点亮它。
第五关：和第四关相同，但在前往另一排之前，必须先点亮同一水平排的所有方格。
第六关：和第四关相同，但必须先点亮水平排的第 2、4、6 排，才能点亮第 1、3、5 排。

Alex located a cache of old EPROMs, later realizing he had come across a copy of Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park for the Atari 2600, a title released for the ColecoVision but which never saw the light of day on the 2600. With the help of long-time Atari enthusiast Joe Grand, all of Alex's finds were dumped. The bulk of the dumps were ColecoVision related, but the Cabbage Patch game for the 2600 turned out to be the find of a lifetime for Atari fans. Alex quickly posted all of the dumped binaries on his blog, including 10 different versions of the Cabbage Patch game. 
 
As luck would have it, Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park is an impressive game, comparable in quality to many modern homebrew games. Cabbage Patch Kids is a side-scrolling game, similar to Pitfall! in this regard. The game consists of various screens that have different obstacles that must be overcome in order to proceed to the next screen. These include water-filled pits, bouncing balls, floating platforms, bees, and fires. You must complete ten screens on each level before a timer runs out. While traversing the screens you can also use trampolines to collect objects hidden in the trees for additional points. 
 
Our thanks go out to Alex Handy for graciously sharing all of his impressive flea market haul with the classic gaming community.","多亏了亚历克斯·汉迪（Alex Handy）在加利福尼亚州一个跳蚤市场的发现，又一款长期失传且未发布的游戏原型如今重见天日。亚历克斯找到了一批旧的可擦可编程只读存储器（EPROM），后来他意识到自己偶然发现了一份雅达利2600版的《椰菜娃娃：公园大冒险》，这款游戏曾在科乐美视（ColecoVision）主机上发布，但从未在雅达利2600主机上推出过。在资深雅达利爱好者乔·格兰德（Joe Grand）的帮助下，亚历克斯找到的所有内容都被提取了出来。提取的大部分内容都与科乐美视主机有关，但雅达利2600版的《椰菜娃娃》游戏对雅达利粉丝来说堪称一生难得的发现。亚历克斯很快就在他的博客上发布了所有提取的二进制文件，其中包括《椰菜娃娃》游戏的10个不同版本。

说来也巧，《椰菜娃娃：公园大冒险》是一款令人印象深刻的游戏，其质量可与许多现代自制游戏相媲美。《椰菜娃娃》是一款横向卷轴游戏，在这方面与《陷阱！》（Pitfall!）类似。游戏由多个屏幕组成，每个屏幕都有不同的障碍物，必须克服这些障碍物才能进入下一个屏幕。这些障碍物包括积水的坑、弹跳球、浮动平台、蜜蜂和火焰。在每个关卡中，你必须在计时器归零之前完成十个屏幕的挑战。在穿越各个屏幕时，你还可以利用蹦床收集隐藏在树上的物品以获得额外积分。

If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. 
Insect Opponents and Mushrooms
All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:
1. The Centipede
The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.
Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.
The Spider
The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.
The Flea
The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.
The Scorpion
The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.
Mushrooms
Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.
Game Difficulty and Variations
The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:
1. One Player

玩家必须通过按下控制器按钮，用魔杖向靠近的昆虫发射火花来得分。按住控制器按钮，魔杖将进入连射模式。如果玩家被昆虫咬到，将会暂时瘫痪，并失去三根初始魔杖中的一根。

昆虫对手与蘑菇
所有敌方昆虫在发动攻击前都会发出独特的声音，这或许能帮助玩家识别是哪种昆虫在攻击。游戏中的敌人和物体如下：
1. 蜈蚣
蜈蚣会发起12波攻击。在第一波攻击中，蜈蚣由1个头和11个身体节段组成。在第二波攻击中，蜈蚣除了有一个连接着10个身体节段的头之外，还有一个分离的头。第三波攻击中，蜈蚣有一个连接着的头、9个身体节段，外加两个分离的头。这些身体节段会变成头，如此循环，直到第12波。在最后一波攻击中，蜈蚣会有12个分离的头，各自独立地攻击玩家。蜈蚣的头比身体节段得分更高。
蜈蚣会从屏幕顶部向下发动攻击。如果火花击中蜈蚣的任何部位，该身体节段会变成蘑菇，而它后面的身体节段会成为新的蜈蚣头。当蜈蚣被消灭后，它会短暂消失，然后再次从屏幕顶部出现。

蜘蛛
蜘蛛会试图分散玩家攻击蜈蚣的注意力。它会摧毁它碰到的任何蘑菇。如果在较近的距离击中蜘蛛，得分会更高。

跳蚤
如果玩家摧毁了大部分现有的蘑菇，跳蚤就会出现。它会掉落下来，在落地的地方生成一批新的蘑菇。跳蚤被击中两次后会消失。第一次被击中后，跳蚤掉落的速度会快很多。

蝎子
蝎子会在第三波攻击中出现。它移动缓慢，但会逐渐加速。在移动过程中，它会使它碰到的任何蘑菇中毒。

蘑菇
蘑菇遍布魔法森林，它们可以作为玩家的障碍物或掩护，同时对敌方昆虫有额外的影响。需要射击四次才能完全摧毁一个蘑菇。蘑菇有两种类型：魔法蘑菇和毒蘑菇。魔法蘑菇是游戏中的默认蘑菇，也是玩家消灭昆虫或蜈蚣身体节段的结果。毒蘑菇是蝎子碰到蘑菇后的产物。毒蘑菇会促使附近的蜈蚣直接穿过任何蘑菇向玩家移动。失去一根魔杖会修复任何部分受损的蘑菇。

游戏难度与模式
游戏提供四种难度级别：新手、标准、高级和专家。游戏模式如下：
1. 单人模式
2. 双人交替模式
当当前玩家被咬伤时，两名玩家将轮流进行游戏。
3. 双人竞赛模式
两名玩家将同时出现在屏幕上，得分单独计算。一名玩家发射的子弹会使另一名玩家瘫痪。
4. 团队合作模式
两名玩家将同时出现在屏幕上，得分合并计算。一名玩家发射的子弹不会使另一名玩家瘫痪。

得分规则
玩家每获得12000分将赢得一根额外的魔法魔杖，最多可拥有六根魔杖。当所有魔杖都丢失时，游戏结束。得分规则如下：

To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.
To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.
Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square.  To carry out the en passant, you must advance your
pawn to the fifth rank.  Your opponent then has the option of moving
his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two
squares.  If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.

Only people who saw it on display at the 1983 CES show would have know about it and ordered it so while it's not technically a prototype, it's close enough.  I've racked my brain on how to best describe the gameplay of this game, and after much searching I've determined the best description is in Leonard Herman's ""ABC's to the VCS"" (pick up a copy today!).  Since Confrontation uses a programming trick to display so many objects on the screen at once, screenshots will only show one players pieces at a time.  Take my word for it, they're really all there. 
 
Confrontation is a very unique game which can only be played by two opposing players.  In this unusual chess-like game, each player controls four pawns and a captain.  The blue player's pawns are lined up vertically along the left border of the playfield while the red player's pawns are along the right. Blue's Captain is at the top center of the playfield and red's is at the bottom.  The object of the game is to move your four pawns to the opposite side of the board where they will be removed.  Once all of your pawns are gone, you must get your captain over to your opponent's side of the board and remove it also.  The first player to remove all of his pieces wins the game.  
 
Confrontation is a highly original strategy game in an era when fast paced action and shooting games were all rage.  If more innovative games like this had been released the crash of 83-84 may not have happened.  But as we all know the video game industry was done in by bad clone after bad clone, and Answer Software was not immune to its effects.  Games like Confrontation were left in dust, never even reaching store shelves.","《对抗》是一款奇特的策略游戏，它从未进行商业发行，但曾在短时间内可直接从安索公司（Answer）处获取。只有在1983年消费电子展上看到它展示的人才会了解并订购这款游戏。所以，虽然严格来说它不算原型产品，但也相去不远。我绞尽脑汁想最好地描述这款游戏的玩法，经过大量查找，我发现伦纳德·赫尔曼所著的《雅达利2600游戏指南》（今天就去买一本吧！）里的描述最为恰当。由于《对抗》运用了一种编程技巧来同时在屏幕上显示众多物体，截图一次只能显示一方玩家的棋子。相信我，实际上所有棋子都在那里。

《对抗》是一款非常独特的游戏，只能由两名对手玩家进行对战。在这个类似国际象棋的独特游戏中，每位玩家控制四个卒和一名队长。蓝色玩家的卒沿着游戏区域的左边界垂直排列，而红色玩家的卒则沿着右边界排列。蓝色队长位于游戏区域的顶部中央，红色队长位于底部。游戏目标是将你的四个卒移动到棋盘的另一侧，然后将它们移除。一旦你的所有卒都被移除，你必须把你的队长移动到对手的棋盘一侧并也将其移除。第一个移除所有棋子的玩家获胜。

在那个快节奏动作游戏和射击游戏风靡一时的时代，《对抗》是一款极具创意的策略游戏。如果能发行更多像这样具有创新性的游戏，1983 - 1984年的游戏业崩溃或许就不会发生。但我们都知道，电子游戏行业被一个又一个劣质的仿冒品拖垮，安索软件公司也未能免受其影响。像《对抗》这样的游戏被埋没，甚至都没能摆上商店的货架。"

你要在迷宫中移动，收集饼干并把它们带回饼干罐。
第一到第三关为单人游戏，第四到第十关支持单人或双人游戏。
在第一、二、三关中，你操控饼干怪兽在迷宫中移动，拿到饼干后一次一个地送回饼干罐。每通过一个迷宫，饼干怪兽会逐个吃掉每块饼干。每局游戏有三个迷宫。第一关分别有一、二、三块饼干；第二关分别有四、五、六块饼干；第三关分别有七、八、九块饼干。
第四到第六关设有时间限制。你可以一次携带多块饼干，在时间耗尽前持续挑战迷宫。第四、五、六关的时间限制分别为五分钟、四分钟和三分钟。
第七到第九关同样设有时间限制，但这次你扮演饼干小子。你要为饼干怪兽的惊喜派对收集饼干。由于他还不知情，所以在围栏的另一边来回踱步。每次你捡起一块饼干，饼干怪兽就会跳过围栏追你。他会吃掉他追来路上的所有饼干，要是被他抓住，他会把你手里的饼干都吃掉。第七、八、九关的时间限制分别为五分钟、四分钟和三分钟。
第十关和第九关一样（限时三分钟，你扮演饼干小子并被饼干怪兽追赶），不过迷宫是隐形的。当你捡起一块饼干时，迷宫会闪现一秒，这样你就能找出最快的路线。
每把一块饼干放进罐子里得一分。

To energize a nest block, you must hit a block while a termite is still carrying it. This will energize all the blocks on the screen.
If you shoot a termite that is not carrying a block or if one is carrying a block but you only hit the termite, all the blocks will not be energized and not be damageable. If you run into a block, energized or not, or are touched by a termite, you lose a life.

和其他模拟游戏一样，这款游戏的玩法包括起飞、飞行、战斗和降落。不过，大部分玩法都围绕着与敌机进行空战（躲避导弹）展开。此外，还有夜间飞行任务，由于视野受限，难度会增加。
然而，起飞和降落也需要额外的技巧，因为你是在“企业”号航母（与《星际迷航》无关）上进行操作，而不是在普通的跑道上。起飞前要留意飞行甲板指挥官（因为在这方面他说了算……而且暂时先别撞到他）。
你的武器包括一挺M61机枪和3种不同型号的AIM导弹（AIM - 7、AIM - 9、AIM - 54），每种导弹各有15枚（这可不少呢！）。
每次任务结束后，你会根据飞行技巧、击落敌机数量和发射武器数量获得一个任务评级。"

IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.
IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)
You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.
As you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).
After you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.
You start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.
Game variations
After you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.
The difficulty settings are:
Easy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.
Normal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.
Hard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from fireball strikes are never regained.
The difficulty switches are not used.
After you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the game.
Scoring
Readiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the screen, up to a maximum of 6.
Damage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points, etc.
Destroy the left or right generator=2000 points
Destroy the center generator=5000 points

你使用操纵杆来控制飞船向左、向右、向上或向下移动。按下开火按钮发射鱼雷。如果你按住开火按钮，你可以控制鱼雷向左或向右移动，或者加速。不过要注意，在你控制鱼雷时，你的飞船不会移动，可能会受到损伤或被摧毁。
当你对“它”的发电机造成损伤时，护盾A、B和C会出现无敌区域。这些区域会在护盾上移动，游戏进行得越久，就越难让鱼雷穿过护盾。如果你在15秒内没有攻击左右两侧的发电机，“它”会降下护盾C，减少你的机动空间。你还会扣分（见下面的计分规则）。
当你摧毁左右两侧的发电机后，中间的发电机就会显露出来。摧毁它，你就赢得了游戏。然而，当你攻击中间的发电机时，护盾D会升起，所以你必须尽快行动。

游戏难度选项
按下开火按钮选择操纵杆后，你可以通过上下移动操纵杆来选择难度。
难度设置如下：
简单（方形）=火球发射速度慢，护盾无敌区域小，你有维修人员。
普通（X）=火球发射速度正常，护盾无敌区域正常，你有维修人员。
困难（菱形）=火球发射速度快，护盾无敌区域正常，你没有维修人员。这意味着被火球击中损失的飞船无法恢复。
难度切换功能未使用。
选择好难度后，将操纵杆向右移动开始游戏。
计分规则
待命得分=每隔几秒，屏幕底部每有一艘备用飞船你就会获得1分，最多6分。
损伤得分=对发电机的攻击次数乘以十。例如，第一次攻击得10分，第七次攻击得70分，第十二次攻击得120分，以此类推。
摧毁左右两侧的发电机=2000分
摧毁中间的发电机=5000分

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.
Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, ""living"" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.
Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.","《大金刚》于1981年在街机上发布，它不仅是任天堂公司的第一款真正意义上的热门游戏，还标志着该公司两个最受欢迎的吉祥物的登场：马里奥（最初名为“跳跃人”）和大金刚。
《大金刚》是一款平台动作游戏，在游戏中，马里奥要攀爬四个不同工业主题的关卡（建筑工地、水泥厂、电梯主题关卡，以及从钢梁上拆除铆钉的关卡），试图在计时器归零之前，从这只大猩猩手中救出被困的少女宝琳。当最后一关的铆钉被拆除后，大金刚倒下，这对恋人得以团聚。此后，游戏将以更高的难度重新开始。
在游戏过程中，马里奥必须躲避不断飞来的木桶、“活”火球和弹簧秤砣。虽然不像在其他后续游戏中那样强大，但马里奥可以找到一把锤子，在有限的时间内用它摧毁木桶和火球。此外，马里奥还可以找到宝琳的帽子、钱包和雨伞，以获得额外的奖励分数。
《大金刚》还因是最早以电子游戏形式呈现完整叙事的游戏之一而闻名，它通过简单的过场动画来推动故事发展。还需注意的是，在20世纪80年代早期游戏机版本的游戏中，《大金刚》通常只采用了原游戏中的两到三个关卡，水泥厂关卡通常会被省略。"

Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong.  In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.
Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.
Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.
In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.
Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.","马里奥绑架了小金刚的爸爸！
小金刚最初于1982年作为《大金刚》的续作在街机上发布。在这款游戏中，马里奥扮演反派角色，最终抓住了大金刚，并把这只猿猴关进了一个锁着的笼子里。玩家将扮演小金刚，必须通过四个不同的关卡（藤蔓关、跳板关、铁链关和马里奥的藏身之处），试图找到钥匙来解救小猴子的父亲。
一路上，马里奥将派出大嘴鳄、俯冲而下的紫色小鸟和电火花，试图阻止小金刚。小金刚可以通过将关卡周围找到的水果砸向敌人的脑袋来保护自己。一块水果在下落过程中击中的敌人越多，获得的奖励分数就越高。
小金刚还可以一次抓住两条铁链或藤蔓，更快地爬开，或者跳过敌人，从而更轻松地避开敌人。然而，任何长时间的坠落或在某些关卡掉进水里都意味着小金刚会失去一条命。
在最后的过场动画中，小金刚将解救大金刚，在踢了马里奥一脚后，两者都将逃脱。一旦所有四个关卡都通关，游戏将以更高的难度重新开始。

Well I hate disappoint you but there aren't herds of rampaging elk in this game, in fact this game has nothing to do with elks at all!  Elk Attack is really a port of the obscure Taito arcade game Electric Yo-Yo! Programmer Mark Hahn named the game Elk Attack as a joke, and probably would have changed the name had it been published. 
 
Silly name aside, Elk Attack is really a Pac-Man type game but without a maze.  You control a Yo-Yo type machine, which must use its string to latch onto and destroy all the colored blocks on the screen.  Along the way you'll encounter strange worm like creatures (sorry no elks), which will attempt to disrupt your Yo-Yo.  To help you fight the worms there are power squares scattered around the board which when grabbed will render your Yo-Yo temporarily invincible and increase your speed.   However unlike Pac-Man touching a worm while invincible will only net you points, and will not destroy of them.  Because of this its best to just go about your business and clear the maze instead of hunting down the worms. 
 
Since you use your string as your main means of propulsion, you must be careful as the screen becomes more and more open. For once you latch onto a block you can't let go until you touch it.  The most common way of dying is to accidentally latch onto a block on the other side of the screen and be sucked into a waiting enemy.  Clearing the board in a set pattern is the best way to avoid leaving large (and potentially dangerous) gaps between blocks.","有了“麋鹿攻击”这样的名字，你可能会以为这是一款关于成群致命狂奔麋鹿的游戏，对吧？很遗憾要让你失望了，这款游戏里并没有成群狂奔的麋鹿，事实上，这款游戏和麋鹿根本毫无关系！《麋鹿攻击》实际上是太东一款鲜为人知的街机游戏《电子悠悠球》的移植版！程序员马克·哈恩开玩笑地给这款游戏取名为《麋鹿攻击》，如果这款游戏正式发行，他可能会改掉这个名字。

抛开这个滑稽的名字不谈，《麋鹿攻击》实际上是一款类似《吃豆人》的游戏，但没有迷宫。你操控一个悠悠球式的机器，它必须用绳子钩住并摧毁屏幕上所有的彩色方块。一路上你会遇到奇怪的蠕虫状生物（抱歉，没有麋鹿），它们会试图干扰你的悠悠球。为了帮助你对抗这些蠕虫，棋盘上散落着能量方块，当你拿到它们时，你的悠悠球会暂时无敌并提高速度。然而，与《吃豆人》不同的是，在无敌状态下碰到蠕虫只会为你赢得分数，并不会消灭它们。因此，最好的做法是专注于清理方块，而不是去追捕蠕虫。

由于你主要依靠绳子来移动，当屏幕变得越来越开阔时，你必须格外小心。因为一旦你钩住一个方块，在碰到它之前你无法松开绳子。最常见的死亡方式是不小心钩住屏幕另一边的方块，然后被吸进等着你的敌人那里。按照一定的模式清理方块是避免在方块之间留下大的（且可能危险的）空隙的最佳方法。"

If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.
The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)

The premise behind Frog pond is simple, you control a frog who must try and catch various insects with its tongue in a race to see how many points you can score.  The game subject and total lack of difficulty almost guarantee that it was to going to be aimed at small children, much like Nick Tuner's previous game Demons to Diamonds.  The problem with children's games is that they're really not alot of fun for adults to play, and Frog Pond is no exception.  
 
If Frog Pond looks familiar to you it's probably because it's an almost exact copy of Mattel's Frog Bog, which was released for the 2600 as Frogs and Flies under the M-Network label.  According to Nick Turner, this is a completely coincidence and neither company had any idea what the other had been working on.  According to Nick he wanted to add more options and gameplay to the game, expanding it to 8K.  Atari wasn't keen on spending the extra money on more memory for a children's game, and refused to allocate the extra 4K.  Frog Pond was shelved and Nick left Atari shortly afterwards. 
 
As you might expect the gameplay is very simple.  Every time you press the fire button, your frog jumps and shoots out his tongue.  If your tongue hits an insect you score points and your frog gets a pleasant snack.  The are several different insects to catch, which are worth varying amounts of points. 
 
While the larger insects are slightly faster than the smaller ones, they still don't put up much of fight.  However if you take too long to grab your bug he'll fly away.  If you miss six insects the sun sets and the games ends.","《青蛙池塘》背后的历史有点模糊，它要么是生不逢时的牺牲品，要么是管理层与程序员之间纷争的产物。《青蛙池塘》的游戏设定很简单，你操控一只青蛙，必须用它的舌头去捕捉各种昆虫，看你能在这场竞赛中获得多少分。游戏主题以及完全没有难度这一点，几乎可以肯定它的目标受众是小孩子，就像尼克·特纳之前的游戏《恶魔变钻石》一样。儿童游戏的问题在于，成年人玩起来真的没什么乐趣，《青蛙池塘》也不例外。

如果你觉得《青蛙池塘》看起来很眼熟，那可能是因为它几乎是美泰公司的《青蛙沼泽》的翻版，《青蛙沼泽》在2600主机上以《青蛙与苍蝇》的名称，由M网络公司发行。据尼克·特纳说，这完全是巧合，两家公司都不知道对方在开发什么游戏。据尼克说，他想为这款游戏增加更多选项和玩法，将其扩展到8K。但雅达利公司不愿意为一款儿童游戏在更多内存上多花钱，拒绝分配额外的4K内存。《青蛙池塘》被搁置，尼克不久后就离开了雅达利。

正如你所料，游戏玩法非常简单。每次你按下射击按钮，你的青蛙就会跳跃并伸出舌头。如果你的舌头碰到一只昆虫，你就会得分，你的青蛙还能享受一顿美味的小吃。有几种不同的昆虫可以捕捉，它们的分值各不相同。

虽然较大的昆虫比小昆虫稍微快一点，但它们也不会怎么反抗。不过，如果你花太长时间去抓虫子，它就会飞走。如果你错过六只昆虫，太阳就会落山，游戏结束。"

Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for ""ghost alarms"" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.
As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures.

cb27dc77050fc3444699b335a55832d5,Kamikaze Saucers (USA) (Proto).zip,Kamikaze Saucers,神风飞碟,"Kamikaze Saucers was a little known 2600 game that most people assumed was never even started.  However after the programmer gave the rom image to Atari Age to be distributed to the gaming community, the game proved to be very much real.  There was no mention of Kamikaze Saucers on any game list, but Syncro did take out full page ads for the game so they must have been close to releasing it.  All these things make this prototype all the more interesting, and makes one wonder what other games Syncro may have had in the works. 
 
Kamikaze Saucers is your average shooter along the lines of Atlantis or Demon Attack.  You must shoot down the saucers that buzz across the screen using your oversized phallic looking ship.  If if fail to shoot the saucers down in a timely manner they will go Kamikaze on you big time!  Three large ships will come at you from the top of the screen, and if you can't destroy them before they crash into you you'll lose a life. 
 
Thankfully there's a little more to Kamikaze Saucers than mindless shooting.  Notice the two meters on each side of the screen?  These are your ammo meters, the left meter is for shooting from the left and the right meter for shooting on the right.  For some reason, shooting from the center counts as shooting from the left (as far as ammo is concerned).

《神风飞碟》是一款类似《亚特兰蒂斯》或《恶魔攻击》的普通射击游戏。你必须用你那外形怪异、类似阳具的飞船击落那些在屏幕上呼啸而过的飞碟。如果你不能及时击落飞碟，它们就会对你发起疯狂的“神风”攻击！会有三艘大型飞船从屏幕顶部向你飞来，如果你不能在它们撞上你之前将其摧毁，你就会失去一条命。

值得庆幸的是，《神风飞碟》可不只是无脑射击。注意屏幕两侧的两个计量表了吗？它们是你的弹药计量表，左边的计量表用于左侧射击，右边的计量表用于右侧射击。出于某种原因，从中间射击在弹药计算上算作左侧射击。《神风飞碟》的射击方式有点像《亚特兰蒂斯》，你所有的射击都会朝着屏幕中心。所以从左侧或右侧射击时，你的子弹会像《亚特兰蒂斯》的侧炮一样向中心倾斜。这需要一点时间来适应，但实际上让游戏更具挑战性。"

Rather than being aliens or spaceships, however, the enemies in this game are various objects such as hamburgers, bow ties, and steam irons. The object is to shoot them down before the energy bar at the bottom of screen is depleted, all while avoiding the oncoming enemies and their own projectiles attacks. Each of the enemies fly in select patterns and as soon as they hit the bottom of the screen, they re-appear at the top until shot by the player. The player's spacecraft depicted in the game is a cross between the U.S.S. Enterprise and Klingon battlecruiser from the Star Trek universe. 
Gameplay-wise and in terms of graphics, MegaMania bears a very strong resemblance to Sega's 1981 arcade title ""Astro Blaster"". Both games feature nearly identical patterns of approaching enemies with the player relying on an ""Energy"" meter. Also, the player's ship bears a remarkable similarity in both games.

从游戏玩法和画面来看，《疯狂大冒险》与世嘉1981年推出的街机游戏《太空爆破手》极为相似。两款游戏中敌人逼近的模式几乎相同，玩家都要依靠“能量”计量表。此外，两款游戏中玩家操控的飞船也非常相似。

Although Meltdown was displayed at the 1983 CES show, it was never seen again after the show closed. 
Meltdown is basically a game of hide and seek that place on a 4x4 grid of atoms.  At the start of each round you will see a rogue quark move about the reactor agitating the atoms.  Each time the quark touches one of atoms it will strip off some of the electrons and atom will shrink.  Once an atom has lost all it's electrons it will become unstable, if all the atoms destabilize the reactor will blow! 
As the only remaining scientist, it is up to you to destroy the quarks and cool down the reactor.   To accomplish this you will have to make use of the only two tools at your disposal: an atomic stabilizer and Cadmium rods.  When the quark jumps to an atom you must line up the stabilizer (on the X axis), line up the Cadmium tube (on the Y axis), and quickly insert a Cadmium rod by pressing the fire button.  However as soon as you destroy one quark another one appears to take its place, so be vigilant and don't let your guard down for a moment. 
The core temperature is represented by a bar displayed at the top of the screen.  As the core cools down, the bar will grow longer, once the bar reaches the center of the screen the reactor will come back under control and the reactor will be saved. Each time you successfully save the reactor the action will get more intense; the number of quarks will multiply, they will begin to move faster, and the electrons will strip off more easily. 
Meltdown is an simple, yet amazingly addictive game.  It's interesting graphical style and progressive difficulty ramping makes Meltdown a game that's hard to put down.","不要将这款游戏与同名的雅达利游戏（该游戏为雅达利 7800 主机所发行）相混淆，《核熔毁》是 20 世纪福克斯开发的最后一批游戏之一，但从未发行。尽管《核熔毁》曾在 1983 年的消费电子展上展出，但展会结束后就再也没有它的消息了。
《核熔毁》基本上是一款在 4x4 原子网格上进行的捉迷藏游戏。每一轮开始时，你会看到一个游离夸克在反应堆中移动，扰动着原子。每次夸克触碰到一个原子，就会剥离一些电子，原子会随之缩小。一旦一个原子失去了所有电子，它就会变得不稳定，如果所有原子都不稳定，反应堆就会爆炸！
作为唯一幸存的科学家，你要负责消灭夸克并冷却反应堆。要做到这一点，你必须利用仅有的两种工具：原子稳定剂和镉棒。当夸克跳到一个原子上时，你必须将稳定剂（在 X 轴上）对齐，将镉管（在 Y 轴上）对齐，然后通过按下射击按钮迅速插入一根镉棒。然而，一旦你消灭了一个夸克，另一个夸克就会出现取而代之，所以要保持警惕，一刻也不能放松。
核心温度由屏幕顶部的一个进度条表示。随着核心冷却，进度条会变长，一旦进度条到达屏幕中央，反应堆就会重新得到控制，反应堆就被拯救了。每次你成功拯救反应堆，游戏的节奏就会变得更加紧张；夸克的数量会增加，它们的移动速度会加快，电子也会更容易被剥离。
《核熔毁》是一款简单却令人上瘾的游戏。它有趣的图形风格和逐渐增加的难度，让《核熔毁》成为一款让人难以放下的游戏。"

29afc03ee5ec3a09ac36b72b3db15335,Monster Cise (USA) (Proto).zip,Monster Cise,怪物健身操,"The history of this game is a bit of mystery.  According to the copyright message its part of the Children's Computer Worshop series (the Sesame Street series), but its part number (CX-26131) and late copyright date (1984) are well outside the Children's Series range (CX-26101 - CX-26115).  Atari may have been planning some kind of series for young children and infants in order to reach as wide an audience as possible.  There is evidence of this as prototypes for other children's games such as Peek-A-Boo and Honker Bonker fall into this part number range.  This prototype even uses the Kid's Controller, which further supports this theory. 
 
The only known version of Monstercise is rather incomplete, and much like Grovers Music Maker, there's actually very little gameplay involved.  The screen displays a group of monsters doing what appear to be Jumping Jacks.  At the bottom of the screen is a blue blob (which is assumed to be Cookie Monster) holding a spotlight.  Pressing the # or * buttons on the Kids Controller will cause Cookie Monster to move left or right, and when you get underneath a monster the spotlight will shoot a beam and highlight the monster.  Once the monster is highlighted, you can control his (its?) head, arms, or legs by pressing the the keys on the keypad.  Each body part seems to have two different actions (three if you count not doing anything).  The head can blink or nod up and down, the arms can either flap or pump up and down, and the legs can kick out or squat.  After awhile the whole thing begins to look like a creepy exercise video, which may be where the name came from. 
  
  
Needless to say the market for children's games was almost non-existent in 1984, as the videogame industry was crashing fast.  Monstercise was probably scrapped due to lack of a market for such a game, or even possibly because of the gameplay was too similar to Grover's Music Maker (which was also not released).  Many game ideas which sound good for demo never evolve enough to be turned into full fledged games, and Monstercise may have suffered this fate.  It's unknown if any more work was ever done on this title.","这款游戏的历史有点神秘。根据版权信息，它是儿童电脑工坊系列（芝麻街系列）的一部分，但它的产品编号（CX - 26131）和较晚的版权日期（1984年）远远超出了儿童系列的范围（CX - 26101 - CX - 26115）。雅达利可能曾计划为幼儿和婴儿推出某种系列游戏，以尽可能扩大受众群体。有证据表明这一点，因为其他儿童游戏的原型，如《躲猫猫》和《洪克邦克》都在这个产品编号范围内。这个原型甚至使用了儿童控制器，这进一步支持了这一理论。

目前已知的《怪物健身操》版本相当不完整，和《格罗弗的音乐制作》一样，实际上游戏玩法非常少。屏幕上显示一群怪物在做类似开合跳的动作。屏幕底部有一个蓝色的团块（推测是饼干怪兽）拿着一个聚光灯。按下儿童控制器上的“#”或“*”按钮会使饼干怪兽向左或向右移动，当你移到某个怪物下方时，聚光灯会射出一道光并照亮该怪物。一旦怪物被照亮，你就可以通过按小键盘上的按键来控制它的头部、手臂或腿部。每个身体部位似乎有两种不同的动作（如果算上什么都不做的话就是三种）。头部可以眨眼或上下点头，手臂可以拍打或上下摆动，腿部可以踢腿或蹲下。过了一会儿，整个画面看起来就像一个诡异的健身视频，这可能就是游戏名称的由来。

不用说，1984年儿童游戏市场几乎不存在，因为电子游戏行业正在迅速崩溃。《怪物健身操》可能因为这类游戏缺乏市场而被搁置，甚至可能是因为其游戏玩法与《格罗弗的音乐制作》过于相似（后者也未发布）。许多在演示时听起来不错的游戏创意最终都未能发展成成熟的游戏，《怪物健身操》可能就遭遇了这样的命运。目前尚不清楚这款游戏是否还有后续开发工作。"

It was supposed to teach important concepts such as spatial orientation, direction, and memory that build a child's self-esteem and teach them to have fun on the 2600.
Since Peek-A-Boo was intended for very young children the gameplay is very simple.  The main character of this game (a cat named Smart Seymour) moves in and out from behind a square.  Depending on the game selected the various elements of the game change slightly.  The square may be a single block, a rectangle, or four colored squares.  The cat may move far away from the square, or he may barely move half his body out.  The cat may move rapidly in and out from behind the square, or he may stay behind the square.  There are eight different types of games, each with a slightly different objective.
Before starting the game, the first thing you must do is turn the kids controller sideways to the left (so the top row read 3 6 9 #, middle row reads 2 5 8 0, and bottom row reads 1 4 7 *).
-Game 1: Single BlocknnThis is the easiest of all the games.  All of the buttons work to move Seymour behind the block or out from behind it in various directions.
-Game 2: Horizontal BarnnIn this game the top row of buttons (3 6 9 #) moves Seymour up, the bottom row (1 4 7 *) moves Seymour down, and the middle row (2 5 8 0) gives you an error sound.  As with all the other game variations, all of the buttons work to move Seymour behind the line.
-Game 3: Vertical BarnnIn this game buttons 1 2 3 4 5 6 move Seymour to the left while buttons 7 8 9 * 0 # move him to the right.
-Game 4: Single BlocknnIn this game buttons 6 and 9 move Seymour up, 4 and 7 move him down, 1 2 3 moves him left, and * 0 # moves him right.  Buttons 5 and 8 give the error sound.
-Game 5: Four BlocksnnIn this game you have to press the right buttons depending on which block Seymour is behind.  Buttons 3 and 6 move him from behind the top left block, 9 and # move him from behind the top right block, 1 and 4 move him from behind the bottom left block, and 7 and * move him from behind bottom right block.  All of the middle buttons 2580 give the error sound.
-Game 6: Four Colored BlocksnnIn this game the buttons are assigned different colors that correspond to the colored blocks.  Buttons 1 2 3 moves Seymour from behind the green block, 456 for the red block, 7 8 9 for the tan block, and 0 * # moves Seymour from behind the blue block.
-Games 7 & 8: 4 Blocks/4 Colored BlocksnnThese last two games are a bit of a mystery.

Peek-A-Boo holds a minor place in Atari history as being the first video game designed with a psychologist.","据雅达利（Atari）称，《躲猫猫》是一款基于人们熟知的“躲猫猫”和“捉迷藏”概念的革命性新视频游戏。它旨在教授重要的概念，如空间定位、方向和记忆，这些能增强孩子的自尊心，并让他们在雅达利2600游戏机上享受乐趣。
由于《躲猫猫》是为低龄儿童设计的，所以游戏玩法非常简单。这款游戏的主角（一只名叫聪明西摩的猫）会在一个方块后面进进出出。根据所选的游戏，游戏的各种元素会稍有变化。这个方块可能是一个单一方块、一个长方形，或者是四个彩色方块。猫可能会远离方块移动，也可能只是把半个身子移出来一点。猫可能会在方块后面快速进出，也可能一直待在方块后面。有八种不同类型的游戏，每种游戏的目标都稍有不同。
在开始游戏前，你要做的第一件事是将儿童控制器向左横放（这样顶行显示3 6 9 #，中间行显示2 5 8 0，底行显示1 4 7 *）。
- 游戏1：单一方块
这是所有游戏中最简单的。所有按钮都可用于让西摩在方块后面或从方块后面向不同方向移动。
- 游戏2：水平条块
在这个游戏中，顶行按钮（3 6 9 #）可让西摩向上移动，底行按钮（1 4 7 *）可让西摩向下移动，中间行按钮（2 5 8 0）会发出错误提示音。和其他所有游戏变体一样，所有按钮都可让西摩移到线条后面。
- 游戏3：垂直条块
在这个游戏中，按钮1 2 3 4 5 6可让西摩向左移动，而按钮7 8 9 * 0 #可让他向右移动。
- 游戏4：单一方块
在这个游戏中，按钮6和9可让西摩向上移动，4和7可让他向下移动，1 2 3可让他向左移动，* 0 #可让他向右移动。按钮5和8会发出错误提示音。
- 游戏5：四个方块
在这个游戏中，你必须根据西摩藏在哪个方块后面来按下正确的按钮。按钮3和6可让他从左上角的方块后面移出来，9和#可让他从右上角的方块后面移出来，1和4可让他从左下角的方块后面移出来，7和*可让他从右下角的方块后面移出来。所有中间的按钮2 5 8 0都会发出错误提示音。
- 游戏6：四个彩色方块
在这个游戏中，按钮被分配了不同的颜色，与彩色方块相对应。按钮1 2 3可让西摩从绿色方块后面移出来，4 5 6对应红色方块，7 8 9对应棕褐色方块，0 * #可让西摩从蓝色方块后面移出来。
- 游戏7和8：四个方块/四个彩色方块
最后这两个游戏有点神秘。按下任何按钮都会让西摩向不同方向移动，只有两个中间的按钮（5和8）在让他从方块后面移出来时会发出错误提示音。也许这些游戏还未完成，或者你需要有孩子的思维才能理解它们（你可能会觉得我应该能胜任）。
《躲猫猫》在雅达利的历史中占据着一个小地位，它是第一款与心理学家合作设计的视频游戏。"

While exploring the planet Cluck, our intrepid hero was set upon by space chickens. Captain Link must destroy them before they make their way all the way to the planet. He does this by firing link sausages up at the chickens. But the chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. If one hits Link, he will be turned into...a chicken!

Row four=70 points
Row five=100 points
Hitting Gonzo=300 points
Destroying all the chickens=1000 point bonus

There are three different kinds of apes in this game: chimpanzees - these little guys are harmless and can be touched without fear; orangutans are a bit bigger and a lot more dangerous than the chimpanzees, touching them will get you captured; gorillas are the most dangerous of all the apes, not only can they capture you, but they can shoot at you as well.
You must keep an eye on your 'life energy' (which is diminished whenever you are shot) and 'escapes' (which allow you to escape the cages, but also cost you life energy). When the life energy hits zero, the game is over. In a worst-case scenario, you may get trapped in a cage after you've run out of escapes, unable to do anything but wait until the apes shoot you to death. Your ultimate goal is to reach the Statue of Liberty level, at which point your health and escape ability will be recharged, and the game starts over at a higher difficulty level.
-The Forest/The RivernnYou start out in a forest with several apes after you. You can shoot at the apes by pressing the fire button, but since they just keep on coming it's best to run for it. There are also pits scattered throughout the forest, falling into one of these pits will cause your life to deplete rapidly. Your goal is to cross the river to the south - only going south will bring you towards the Forbidden Zone. Touching the river isn't deadly, and you can move through without any trouble - it may be that the river was going to be deadly and a bridge put across it in the early prototype.
-The Village/PrisonnnIf you touched an Orangutan or a Gorilla you end up here. When captured, you're treated to a newly-added full-screen graphic of a man behind bars. You need to be extra careful in the village since the area is cramped, and there are lots of apes roaming around. It's very easy to escape and be captured again right away. You'll also want to escape from the cage as quickly as possible since the apes will constantly hit you while you're trapped in the cage. Moving south will bring you to the desert.
-The DesertnnAfter the village you'll encounter a large featureless desert (formerly the ?Forbidden Zone'). There are more apes here than in any other zone, so you'll have to be on your guard. Moving south will bring you to the caverns.
The CavernsnnThe caverns are the last obstacles on your way to the human stronghold. There are no apes to worry about in the caverns, but unfortunately the caverns are a giant maze. You'll also slowly loose life points as you traverse the caves. There are several ways out of the caves but not every exit will lead you to the stronghold. If you take the wrong path through the caves you'll end up back on the forest screen. Hurry, you are close to reaching your goal!
The Statue of LibertynnOnce you reach the Statue of Liberty there's a newly-added ending which is impressive. You'll also get a brief glimpse of the original ending, which looks pretty pathetic by comparison. The screen will begin to flash and you'll see the Statue of Liberty displayed while the background scrolls through all the screens you've crossed. After this you will start back at the forest screen on the next higher difficulty level. Each new difficulty level has a few changes: the apes will do an extra point of damage when they shoot you; the apes move faster; more apes appear on the screen at once and come out more often; the bonus points for reaching the Statue of Liberty increases by 100.","游戏场景分布在多个画面中：沙漠、森林、猿人村庄、河流渡口、地下洞穴，以及电影中高潮部分的自由女神像场景。

游戏中有三种不同的猿人：黑猩猩——这些小家伙无害，可以放心触碰；猩猩比黑猩猩体型稍大，也危险得多，碰到它们你会被抓住；大猩猩是所有猿人中最危险的，它们不仅能抓住你，还会向你开枪。

你必须留意自己的“生命能量”（每当你被击中时，生命能量就会减少）和“逃脱次数”（逃脱次数能让你从笼子里逃脱，但也会消耗你的生命能量）。当生命能量归零，游戏就结束了。在最坏的情况下，你可能在逃脱次数用完后被困在笼子里，除了等着被猿人开枪打死，别无他法。你的最终目标是到达自由女神像关卡，届时你的生命值和逃脱能力将恢复，游戏将以更高的难度重新开始。

### 森林/河流
游戏开始时，你身处一片森林，几只猿人在后面追你。你可以通过按下射击按钮向猿人开枪，但由于它们源源不断地涌来，最好还是赶紧逃跑。森林里还散布着许多陷阱，掉进其中一个陷阱会让你的生命值迅速减少。你的目标是向南穿过河流——只有向南走才能进入禁区。触碰河流不会致命，你可以顺利通过——也许在早期的原型中，河流原本是致命的，还会有一座桥横跨其上。

### 村庄/监狱
如果你碰到了猩猩或大猩猩，就会来到这里。被抓住后，你会看到一个新添加的全屏画面：一个男人被关在笼子里。在村庄里你要格外小心，因为这里空间狭窄，还有很多猿人四处游荡。很容易逃脱后又马上被抓住。你还需要尽快从笼子里逃脱，因为当你被困在笼子里时，猿人会不断攻击你。向南走会把你带到沙漠。

### 沙漠
离开村庄后，你会遇到一片广袤、毫无特色的沙漠（以前被称为“禁区”）。这里的猿人比其他任何区域都多，所以你必须保持警惕。向南走会把你带到洞穴。

### 洞穴
洞穴是你前往人类据点途中的最后一道障碍。洞穴里没有猿人需要担心，但不幸的是，洞穴是一个巨大的迷宫。在穿越洞穴时，你的生命值也会慢慢减少。洞穴有几个出口，但并非每个出口都能带你到达据点。如果你在洞穴中选错了路，就会回到森林画面。快点，你离目标已经很近了！

### 自由女神像
一旦你到达自由女神像关卡，会看到一个新添加的令人印象深刻的结局画面。你还能短暂地看到原来的结局，相比之下，那个结局显得相当逊色。屏幕会开始闪烁，你会看到自由女神像的画面，同时背景会滚动显示你之前经过的所有场景。之后，游戏将以更高的难度在森林画面重新开始。每个新的难度级别都会有一些变化：猿人开枪时会造成额外的伤害；猿人的移动速度更快；屏幕上同时出现的猿人更多，出现的频率也更高；到达自由女神像关卡的奖励分数会增加100分。"

529a899e9b1c57e55ef28905b0d1a5d6,Pompeii (USA) (Proto).zip,Pompeii,庞贝古城,"Pompeii was one of the last titles announced by Apollo, but went unreleased when Apollo became one of the first 2600 game companies to fold in the wake of the crash.  From box art and a few brief descriptions we can surmise that the game revolved around an Indiana Jones like archaeologist who is trying to find treasures in the ruins of the ancient city of Pompeii.
Unfortunately the only prototype that's surfaced so far is very incomplete.  The background graphics are very well done and depict a smoldering volcano (Mt. Vesuvius) and two strange shapes on either side (treasures?).  Your character hardly looks anything like the Indiana Jones character depicted on the box, but since this is a prototype he may have been ""Indyized"" in later versions.  Your character does have some slight walking animation, but it's far too slow for how quickly he moves.  The brown columns on the playfield are really place holders for enemy creatures which had yet to be defined.
This prototype is little more than a movement demo.  Your character can walk around the bottom half of the screen, but if he gets to close to the top his head becomes truncated (an obvious programming glitch).  When your character walks over the column placeholders, a number (from 1 to 47) is displayed in hexadecimal notation in the lower right of the screen.  Pushing the left controller button will also make a hexadecimal number appear in the lower right corner (from 47 to 8E).
You can make the lava level rise by pressing the right controller button.  The lava pool can extend all the way to the middle of the screen, but once you start raising the lava level there's no way to bring it back down.  As usual, the lava has no affect on your player and he can safely stand in it all day.  Beyond the excitement of walking around and watching the lava rise, there isn't anything else to do in this prototype.
Its hard to judge a game based on such an early prototype, but from what's been implemented Pompeii was looking pretty good.  After several mediocre titles Apollo may have actually had a decent chance with this game, but the crash wouldn't wait for them to prove themselves.","《庞贝古城》是阿波罗公司公布的最后一批游戏之一，但由于阿波罗公司成为雅达利2600游戏市场崩溃后首批倒闭的游戏公司之一，该游戏未能发行。从游戏盒封面和一些简短描述中，我们可以推测，这款游戏围绕一位类似印第安纳·琼斯的考古学家展开，他试图在庞贝古城的废墟中寻找宝藏。
不幸的是，目前出现的唯一原型版本非常不完整。背景图形绘制得非常出色，描绘了一座正在冒烟的火山（维苏威火山），两侧还有两个奇怪的形状（宝藏？）。你的角色看起来和游戏盒上描绘的印第安纳·琼斯形象几乎毫无相似之处，但由于这只是一个原型，在后续版本中他可能会被设计得更像“印第安纳·琼斯”。你的角色有一些简单的行走动画，但动画速度与他的移动速度相比实在太慢。游戏场景中的棕色柱子实际上是尚未定义的敌人生物的占位符。
这个原型版本不过是一个移动演示。你的角色可以在屏幕下半部分走动，但如果他靠近屏幕顶部，他的头部就会被截断（这显然是一个编程漏洞）。当你的角色走过柱子占位符时，屏幕右下角会以十六进制显示一个数字（从1到47）。按下游戏手柄的左键，屏幕右下角也会出现一个十六进制数字（从47到8E）。
你可以通过按下游戏手柄的右键让熔岩水位上升。熔岩池可以一直延伸到屏幕中间，但一旦你开始提升熔岩水位，就无法再让它降下来。和往常一样，熔岩对你的角色没有任何影响，他可以整天安全地站在熔岩里。除了四处走动和看着熔岩上升带来的一点乐趣外，这个原型版本没有其他可玩的内容。
仅根据这样一个早期原型来评判一款游戏是很困难的，但就目前已实现的内容来看，《庞贝古城》看起来相当不错。在推出了几款平庸的游戏之后，阿波罗公司或许真的能凭借这款游戏取得不错的成绩，但市场崩溃可不会等他们证明自己。"

feee49278a3768385896d9fd6c572fdd,Racer (USA) (Proto).zip,Racer,赛车手,"Racer was an original game developed by Roklan for Atari (their first actually), and not based on any existing arcade game.
Roklan was a major 3rd party developer of games back in the 80's, however Roklan generally did not publish games under their own name, so most never knew they existed.
Racer was Roklan's first title for the Atari 2600, and as such, is a rather simple game.  The player controls a car which they must maneuver around the screen and avoid crashing into the walls.  The screen scrolls downward, so you are constantly moving forward.  As such there is no gas button, nor is there a brake button.  All you can do as hang on and dodge those walls!
At the start of the game, the walls move rather slowly.  In fact it is almost impossible to crash into a wall unless you're trying to do it on purpose.  However about every 30 seconds the game will speed up, and the walls will come faster and faster until they become unavoidable to anyone who isn't a Jedi.  This usually happens around the fifth speed up.
Each player starts with three lives, with extra lives being awarded every 30 points.  There are ten different game variations, each one changing the number of players and the speed at which the game starts.  The last two variations are a sort of 'Children's Mode' where the game starts at the slowest speed and never speeds up.
Although the one player version of Racer is rather ho-hum, the game really shines in the two player modes.  Unlike most Atari 2600 games, Racer offers two player simultaneous play.  In the two player variations you and a friend square off against one another in an attempt to get the highest score.  Each player can stay on their side of the screen and try to beat the other player purely based on skill, but why would you want to do that?  The best part of Racer is that you can bang and crash into the other player, forcing them into the oncoming walls.  Of course the other player can do the exact same thing back to you, so be careful.  Careful strategy is needed when deciding what the right time is to ram your car into the other player.
While Racer is an alright game, it lacks long term playability.  The one player game is too simple and ends too quickly, and the two player game isn't much more interesting.  It was probably for this reason that Atari declined to pick up Racer, and Roklan didn't try and put it out themselves.  Racer has potential, but it needs more variation to make it interesting (different wall layouts, an enemy car , power ups, etc.).  Still, Racer is a rare and interesting glimpse into the secret lives of third party developers.","《赛车手》是由罗克兰（Roklan）为雅达利（Atari）开发的一款原创游戏（实际上这是他们的首款作品），并非基于任何现有街机游戏改编。
罗克兰在 80 年代是一家重要的第三方游戏开发商，不过该公司通常不会以自己的名义发行游戏，所以大多数人都不知道他们的存在。
《赛车手》是罗克兰为雅达利 2600 开发的首款游戏，因此是一款相当简单的游戏。玩家操控一辆汽车，必须在屏幕上灵活移动，避免撞到墙壁。屏幕会向下滚动，所以你会一直向前移动。因此，游戏中没有油门按钮，也没有刹车按钮。你所能做的就是紧紧握住操纵杆，躲避那些墙壁！
游戏开始时，墙壁移动得相当缓慢。事实上，除非你故意为之，否则几乎不可能撞到墙壁。然而，大约每 30 秒游戏就会加速，墙壁会越来越快地逼近，直到对于非高手玩家来说根本无法躲避。这种情况通常在第五次加速左右出现。
每个玩家初始有三条命，每获得 30 分就会额外获得一条命。游戏有十种不同的变体，每种变体都会改变玩家数量和游戏起始速度。最后两种变体类似于“儿童模式”，游戏以最慢的速度开始，且不会加速。
虽然《赛车手》的单人模式相当平淡，但这款游戏在双人模式中真正展现出了魅力。与大多数雅达利 2600 游戏不同，《赛车手》支持双人同时游戏。在双人变体中，你和朋友相互对抗，试图获得最高分。每个玩家可以待在屏幕的一侧，纯粹凭借技巧击败对方，但你为什么要这么做呢？《赛车手》最精彩的部分在于你可以撞击另一名玩家，迫使他们撞到迎面而来的墙壁。当然，另一名玩家也可以对你做同样的事，所以要小心。在决定何时用你的车撞向另一名玩家时，需要谨慎制定策略。
虽然《赛车手》是一款还不错的游戏，但它缺乏长期可玩性。单人游戏过于简单，结束得也太快，双人游戏也没有有趣多少。可能正是出于这个原因，雅达利拒绝发行《赛车手》，而罗克兰也没有尝试自行推出这款游戏。《赛车手》有一定潜力，但需要更多的变化才能变得有趣（不同的墙壁布局、敌方车辆、道具等）。尽管如此，《赛车手》还是让我们得以一窥第三方开发商鲜为人知的一面。"

Alert (S.A.C. standing for Strategic Air Command) is the most complete of the five Amiga prototypes that have turned up, unfortunately it is also most uninteresting being quite similar to the M-Network game Air Raiders. 
 After pressing select to choose between a ground or sea mission (the only difference being the color of the ?ground' and the type of enemies you encounter) you will be shown taking off on what has to be the shortest runway in the history of videogames.  Once you are in the air you must shoot at both air and ground/sea targets.  Of course the enemy targets will be shooting back at you, so you must dodge incoming bullets as well. 
You start the game with three planes and 99 units of fuel.  Fuel acts like a timer in this game, and you will crash if it runs out.  In addition to a fuel gauge you also have altimeter showing how high above the ground you are (0 to 50).  Being higher lets you shoot down planes, while being lower lets you shoot ground targets).  Be careful though, if your altitude hits zero the ground will turn black and you will crash after a few seconds.   There are also two warning lights on either side of the status bar, these lights will alert you to different dangers.  They will flash red if you are too low to the ground (under 9), yellow if you're running low on fuel (under 20), and orange if you've taken heavy damage. 
There are three types of enemies in the game.   Planes patrol the air and will swoop towards you, fire, and run off.  Taking these guys out is easiest when they're doing their swooping motion as they'll present the biggest target.  In addition to planes there are anti-aircraft guns (land) and destroyers (sea) that appear at the beginning of the game, but won't actually start firing at you until the third mission.   If you've taken too many damage you can attempt to land for repairs.  To land you need to fly low and look for either a runway (land) or carrier (sea) and line up with it.  Once you're low enough and lined up with the runway, pull up to land. It take a bit of getting used to, but it's not that hard after a few times.   Once you've lost all your lives you will be given a final ranking (crew, pilot, or ace) and rated on your performance (0-9). 
Interestingly it appears that S.A.C. Alert was designed with the Joyboard controller in mind.  The Joyboard was an odd controller Amiga developed where the player stood on a plastic board that was supported on a little suction cup that stuck to the floor.  The idea was that the player would balance themselves and lean in the direction they wanted the character to move.  This worked far better in concept than in reality and makes most games impossible to play, even those designed for the Joyboard itself.  S.A.C. Alert is no different in this regard so it is not recommended that you break out the Joyboard, regardless of what the prototype box artwork says. Either the playtesters at Amiga had super human reflexes and balance, or they were just masochists.","S.A.C. Alert（S.A.C. 代表战略空军司令部）是已发现的五款阿蜜嘉原型游戏中最完整的一款，不幸的是，它也是最无趣的一款，与 M 网络的游戏《空袭者》颇为相似。
按下选择键选择地面或海上任务（唯一的区别是“地面”的颜色和你遇到的敌人类型）后，你会看到飞机从电子游戏史上最短的跑道上起飞。一旦你升空，就必须向空中和地面/海上目标射击。当然，敌方目标也会向你还击，所以你还必须躲避飞来的子弹。
游戏开始时你有三架飞机和 99 单位的燃料。在这款游戏中，燃料就像一个计时器，燃料耗尽你就会坠毁。除了燃油表，你还有一个高度计，显示你离地面的高度（0 到 50）。飞得高可以击落飞机，飞得低可以射击地面目标。不过要小心，如果你的高度降为零，地面会变黑，几秒钟后你就会坠毁。状态栏两侧还有两个警示灯，这些灯会提醒你不同的危险。如果你离地面太近（低于 9），警示灯会闪红色；如果燃料不足（低于 20），会闪黄色；如果你受到重创，会闪橙色。
游戏中有三种类型的敌人。飞机会在空中巡逻，向你俯冲、开火，然后飞走。当这些飞机俯冲时，它们的目标最大，这时击落它们最容易。除了飞机，游戏开始时还会出现高射炮（陆地）和驱逐舰（海上），但直到第三个任务它们才会真正向你开火。如果你受到太多伤害，可以尝试降落进行维修。要降落，你需要低空飞行，寻找跑道（陆地）或航母（海上）并与之对齐。一旦你飞得足够低并与跑道对齐，拉起操纵杆降落。这需要一点时间来适应，但几次之后就没那么难了。当你失去所有生命值后，你会得到一个最终排名（机组人员、飞行员或王牌飞行员），并根据你的表现进行评分（0 - 9）。
有趣的是，《战略空军司令部警报》似乎是为 Joyboard 控制器设计的。Joyboard 是阿蜜嘉开发的一种奇特的控制器，玩家站在一块塑料板上，塑料板由一个小吸盘支撑并固定在地板上。其理念是玩家保持平衡并向想要角色移动的方向倾斜。这个想法在概念上比实际效果要好得多，它让大多数游戏变得无法玩，即使是专门为 Joyboard 设计的游戏也是如此。在这方面，《战略空军司令部警报》也不例外，所以不建议你拿出 Joyboard 来玩，不管原型游戏盒的 artwork 怎么说。要么是阿蜜嘉的测试玩家拥有超人的反应能力和平衡能力，要么他们就是受虐狂。"

cb0beb95b9bcb2420d5763e5ff7ded45,Save Mary! (USA) (Proto).zip,Save Mary!,拯救玛丽！,"Save Mary! was one of those 2600 revival titles that should have been released but was ultimately lost when Atari closed its Atari 2600 operations in 1990.  Save Mary! may have been in development longer than any other Atari 2600 game (over two years according to some sources).  One reason for this was Atari management constantly making changes to an already complex game, but another reason for the long development cycle was that programmer Tod Frye (of Pac-Man fame) may only have been working part time for Atari at the time and was also working on another unreleased 2600 game Shooting Arcade.  No matter what the reasons were it's a shame Save Mary! never got released, as it's a fun and highly original game. 
The game title says it all, the goal of the game is to ""Save Mary!"".  Apparently Mary is a rather stupid girl who has somehow got herself stuck in a canyon that's rapidly filling with water (don't you hate it when that happens?)  Using only a crane and several odd shaped blocks you must build a platform for Mary to climb onto and make it high enough so you can hoist her out with the crane.  However your task is made more difficult due to the shape of the blocks (otherwise it wouldn't be much of a game would it?).  Not all the blocks come in nice little squares, each level has its own unique set of blocks which require clever planning to successfully link them together into a platform for Mary. 
Further complicating things is that Mary appears to have started panicking and will run back and forth around the platform.  Remember that Mary is human (despite the gaping hole in her head!), and like most humans she doesn't take kindly to being squished with blocks (or having them swung into her).  Take special care when dropping blocks not to hit Mary or it's game over.  Also be sure to watch out for the low flying airplane that appears on the higher levels (yes I said Airplane).  If the plane hits your crane you will automatically drop the block you're carrying (possibly squishing Mary). 
Thankfully there are several power-ups to help you accomplish your task.  Power-ups appear on the cliff sides and require that you pick them up and drop them off at the top of the canyon to activate them.  These power-ups do a wide variety of things: 
 
The Plug - Stops the water from rising for a few seconds 
Stop Sign - Makes Mary stop hopping around like an idiot (very handy) 
Oil Can - Makes your crane move faster 
Gold Block - Makes Mary invincible to being squished by falling blocks 
Number - Gives you bonus points 
Mary Figure - Gives you extra life 
 
Save Mary! tends to get tough fast if you don't learn how to make the most of the power-ups, and can quickly get out of control if you don't have a plan for how to stack the blocks.  Strategy and planning are the keys to winning Save Mary!, but taking too long will result in one waterlogged corpse.  Overall Save Mary! is a Tetris variant with enough variety to keep gamers coming back for more.  Atari had a winner on its hands, as Save Mary! was a game that could have made Atari owners say Wow!  Unfortunately the age of the 2600 was over and brilliant efforts like this ultimately came too late to save the dying system.  On an interesting side note Nolan Bushnell himself is quoted as saying that Save Mary! was one of his favorite upcoming Atari 2600 releases.  One would think that with this kind of endorsement Save Mary! would have seen the light of day.","《拯救玛丽！》是那些本应发行的雅达利2600复刻游戏之一，但最终因雅达利于1990年停止其雅达利2600业务而被搁置。《拯救玛丽！》的开发时间可能比其他任何雅达利2600游戏都要长（据某些消息来源称超过了两年）。其中一个原因是雅达利管理层不断对一款本就复杂的游戏进行修改，但开发周期长的另一个原因是程序员托德·弗莱（以《吃豆人》而闻名）当时可能只是兼职为雅达利工作，同时还在开发另一款未发行的雅达利2600游戏《射击街机》。不管原因是什么，《拯救玛丽！》从未发行实在是太可惜了，因为这是一款有趣且极具创意的游戏。
游戏名称已经说明了一切，游戏的目标是“拯救玛丽！”。显然，玛丽是个相当笨的女孩，她不知怎么地被困在了一个迅速被水淹没的峡谷里（你是不是很讨厌这种事发生？）。你只能使用一台起重机和几块形状怪异的方块，必须为玛丽搭建一个平台让她爬上去，并把平台建得足够高，这样你就可以用起重机把她吊出来。然而，由于方块的形状，你的任务变得更加困难（否则这就不算什么游戏了，对吧？）。并非所有的方块都是规整的小正方形，每一关都有其独特的方块组合，需要巧妙规划才能成功地将它们连接成一个供玛丽站立的平台。
更复杂的是，玛丽似乎开始惊慌失措，会在平台上来回奔跑。要记住，玛丽是人类（尽管她头上有个大洞！），和大多数人一样，她可不喜欢被方块压扁（或者被方块砸到）。放下方块时要特别小心，不要砸到玛丽，否则游戏就结束了。还要注意在较高关卡中出现的低空飞行的飞机（没错，我说的是飞机）。如果飞机撞到你的起重机，你手中拿着的方块会自动掉落（可能会压扁玛丽）。
值得庆幸的是，有几种道具可以帮助你完成任务。道具会出现在悬崖边上，你需要把它们捡起来并放到峡谷顶部才能激活它们。这些道具的功能多种多样：
插头——让水停止上涨几秒钟
停车标志——让玛丽不再像个傻瓜一样跳来跳去（非常实用）
油桶——让你的起重机移动得更快
金色方块——让玛丽对掉落的方块的挤压免疫
数字——给你额外的分数
玛丽人偶——给你一条额外的生命
如果你不学会如何充分利用这些道具，《拯救玛丽！》很快就会变得很难，而且如果你没有堆叠方块的计划，游戏很快就会失控。策略和规划是赢得《拯救玛丽！》的关键，但花费太长时间会导致出现一具被水浸湿的尸体。总体而言，《拯救玛丽！》是一款《俄罗斯方块》的变体游戏，有足够的变化让玩家不断回来玩。雅达利本有一款成功之作，因为《拯救玛丽！》本可以让雅达利游戏机的拥有者惊叹不已。不幸的是，雅达利2600的时代已经结束，像这样出色的作品最终来得太晚，无法拯救这个日渐衰落的系统。有趣的是，诺兰·布什内尔本人曾说过，《拯救玛丽！》是他最期待的雅达利2600即将发行的游戏之一。人们会认为，有了这样的认可，《拯救玛丽！》本应该问世的。"

This prototype plays like a cross between a Rubik's Cube and the old sliding tile puzzle game. The goal of the game is to line up all the colors in each row from light to dark. If you've done it correctly the board should look like the start-up screen with the colors descending from red to purple. However lining up all the colors is easier said than done due to the unique way the squares move across the board. 
When you move your square up or down a row or column, the last square in that row will move behind your square's new position. For instance if your square is the light green one (center of the row), and you move it left it will result in the last square in the row (the light blue one) moving behind it. If you move right instead, the last square on the right (the dark blue one) would move behind your square. Mastering how the squares move is essential to solving the puzzle. If you forget what order the squares should go in, pressing the fire button will cause all the squares in the correct positions to turn black. While this is helpful for positioning the shades of color in each row, it won't help you remember what color is supposed to go in each row.","1998 年，本·利亚申科（Ben Liashenko）在一个废品场发现了这款神秘的动视原型游戏，多年来，收藏家们一直未能确定它的身份。这款原型游戏的玩法像是魔方和老式滑动拼图游戏的结合。游戏目标是将每行的所有颜色从浅到深排列整齐。如果你操作正确，游戏棋盘看起来应该和启动画面一样，颜色从红色渐变为紫色。然而，由于方块在棋盘上的独特移动方式，要将所有颜色排列整齐说起来容易做起来难。
当你将方块向上或向下移动一行或一列时，该行的最后一个方块会移动到你方块的新位置后面。例如，如果你的方块是浅绿色的（位于行的中心），你将它向左移动，该行的最后一个方块（浅蓝色的那个）会移动到它后面。如果你向右移动，右边的最后一个方块（深蓝色的那个）会移动到你方块后面。掌握方块的移动方式是解开谜题的关键。如果你忘记了方块应该排列的顺序，按下射击按钮会使所有处于正确位置的方块变成黑色。虽然这有助于排列每行颜色的深浅，但它无法帮助你记住每行应该是什么颜色。"

f01920562265b3382f6f6dcbf663c55b,Shooting Arcade (USA) (Proto).zip,Shooting Arcade,射击街机,"Shooting Arcade is one of only two 2600 games to use the light gun (Sentinel was the other), but was never released.  This is a shame because Shooting Arcade is a creative light gun target game similar to the Point Blank series, and would have been unique among 2600 games.  Interestingly it appears that Shooting Arcade was not developed in the US, but rather in Mexico by a company called Heuristica.  How Axlon was invovled is unknown, but they may have simply sub-contracted the game out to Heuristica instead of doing it themselves. 
Shooting Arcade is really made up of six different scenes that are put together in different orders depending on the level you've selected.  Each scene has its own unique theme, rules, and objective, making Shooting Arcade essentially six games in one.  Depending on which skill level you choose, the scene's attributes change to make it more or less difficult and the timer at the bottom of the screen counts down more or less quickly.  The status bar at the top of the screen shows the number of shots you have left, your current difficulty level, and the number of targets left.  You start each level out with a limited amount of ammunition depending on the difficulty level (40, 10, 5, 2, or 1).  You can continue from the last screen you completed an infinite amount of times by simply pressing the reset button.  This is a handy feature as the game get very hard at the later levels... 
The six scenes are: 
Colored Squares - Here you must shoot out all the colored squares before the timer runs out.  Starting on level 1 if you shoot and empty area where a square would be, a new square appear and you'll have to shoot it again!  On level 4 the squares will all disappear after you take your first shot, and you must memorize where all the squares were before you start.  The squares can briefly be seen when you take a shot which helps a bit, but they will reappear if you shoot the same area twice (as in level 1).  Every square you successfully hit will give you two extra shots. 
Shooting Gallery - This scene is reminiscent of Imagic's Shooting Gallery cartridge.  Here you must shoot various carnival targets such as glass pipes, ducks, milk jugs, colored squares, and dinosaurs?  The targets in the center area move at a fair clip (depending on the difficulty level) and the pipes at the top can be very difficult to hit making this scene one of the toughest in the game.  Speaking of squares, you can shoot the colored squares at the bottom of the screen to gain extra ammo if you're in need.  To clear this scene you must successfully shoot all the targets. 
The Birds - This scene is only accessible from level 2 onward.  In this scene you must shoot all the black and white birds before the timer runs out.  The birds move with a up and down motion, but follow a specific path around the screen so you can predict where they will move.  The background will change from black to white during the course of the scene effectively camouflaging the birds making them even more difficult to hit. 
Target Practice - This scene is one of the hardest to complete, since you begin with almost no ammo and the timer counts down lightning fast.  The concept of this scene is quite simple, you must shoot the various birds which fly around the screen.  Unlike the previous scene, these birds only appear one at a time and they move very very fast.  The birds will wrap around from one side of the screen to the other, so you can try and anticipate where it will appear next.  This scene is only accessible from level 3 onward. 
The Demon - This scene is damn tough!  You must shoot a demon who randomly teleports around the screen.  Since this scene is only accessible on skill level 4 you start low on ammo and have almost no time.  If you shoot the demon enough times you will move onto the final scene. 
The Unicycle - This is the final scene in the game.  Here you must shoot the unicycle out from underneath a poor clown and watch him fall to his death (ok so I made the last part up).  Since the unicycle is very thin and moves at a surprisingly fast clip, this scene is nearly impossible to beat.  Like the demon scene, this scene is only accessible on level 4. 
So why wasn't shooting arcade released?  No one knows the true reason, but one possibility is the horrid controls.  The light gun aim is so off it makes it almost impossible to hit something by aiming directly at it.  If your lucky enough to actually hit something, it's almost a guarantee that you'll never be able to hit it again as the shooting code is so buggy that shooting at the same spot three times in a row will result in hitting three completely different areas of the screen.  This problem is really the death nail for Shooting Arcade, and ruins what could have otherwise been an awesome game. If you can get over the flawed targeting system, Shooting Arcade can be really fun.  It's interesting to see just how much programmers could squeeze out of the ancient 2600.","《射击街机》是仅有的两款使用光枪的雅达利2600游戏之一（另一款是《哨兵》），但它从未发布过。这很可惜，因为《射击街机》是一款富有创意的光枪射击目标游戏，类似于《生死狙击》系列，在雅达利2600游戏中本会独树一帜。有趣的是，《射击街机》似乎并非在美国开发，而是由墨西哥一家名为Heuristica的公司开发的。目前尚不清楚阿克龙公司（Axlon）在其中扮演了什么角色，但他们可能只是将这款游戏外包给了Heuristica，而不是自己开发。
《射击街机》实际上由六个不同的场景组成，这些场景会根据你选择的关卡以不同的顺序组合在一起。每个场景都有其独特的主题、规则和目标，这使得《射击街机》本质上是一款集六种游戏于一体的作品。根据你选择的难度级别，场景的属性会发生变化，从而使游戏难度或高或低，屏幕底部的计时器倒计时速度也会相应变快或变慢。屏幕顶部的状态栏会显示你剩余的射击次数、当前的难度级别以及剩余的目标数量。根据难度级别，你在每个关卡开始时会获得有限的弹药（40发、10发、5发、2发或1发）。你只需按下重置按钮，就可以从你完成的最后一个屏幕无限次继续游戏。这是一个很实用的功能，因为游戏后期的关卡会变得非常难……
这六个场景分别是：
彩色方块——在这个场景中，你必须在计时器归零之前射光所有彩色方块。从第1级开始，如果你射击方块所在的空白区域，会出现一个新的方块，你必须再次射击它！在第4级，你开第一枪后所有方块都会消失，你必须在开始射击前记住所有方块的位置。射击时可以短暂看到方块，这会有点帮助，但如果你两次射击同一区域，方块会再次出现（就像在第1级那样）。每成功击中一个方块，你会获得两发额外弹药。
射击场——这个场景让人想起Imagic公司的《射击场》游戏卡带。在这个场景中，你必须射击各种嘉年华目标，如玻璃管、鸭子、牛奶罐、彩色方块，还有恐龙？中心区域的目标移动速度相当快（取决于难度级别），顶部的玻璃管很难击中，这使得这个场景成为游戏中最难的场景之一。说到方块，如果你需要额外弹药，可以射击屏幕底部的彩色方块。要通关这个场景，你必须成功射击所有目标。
飞鸟——这个场景从第2级开始才能进入。在这个场景中，你必须在计时器归零之前射光所有黑白相间的鸟。鸟会上下移动，但会沿着屏幕周围的特定路径飞行，所以你可以预测它们的移动方向。在场景进行过程中，背景会从黑色变为白色，有效地将鸟隐藏起来，使它们更难被击中。
靶场练习——这个场景是最难通关的场景之一，因为你开始时几乎没有弹药，而且计时器倒计时速度极快。这个场景的概念很简单，你必须射击在屏幕上飞来飞去的各种鸟。与上一个场景不同，这些鸟一次只出现一只，而且移动速度非常非常快。鸟会从屏幕的一侧飞到另一侧，所以你可以试着预测它下次会出现在哪里。这个场景从第3级开始才能进入。
恶魔——这个场景非常难！你必须射击一个在屏幕上随机瞬移的恶魔。由于这个场景只有在技能等级4才能进入，你开始时弹药很少，而且几乎没有时间。如果你多次击中恶魔，就可以进入最后一个场景。
独轮车——这是游戏的最后一个场景。在这个场景中，你必须射倒可怜小丑脚下的独轮车，看着他摔倒（好吧，最后这部分是我编的）。由于独轮车很细，而且移动速度惊人地快，这个场景几乎不可能通关。和恶魔场景一样，这个场景只有在第4级才能进入。
那么，为什么《射击街机》没有发布呢？没有人知道真正的原因，但一种可能性是糟糕的操作体验。光枪的瞄准偏差太大，直接瞄准目标几乎不可能击中。如果你足够幸运真的击中了某个目标，几乎可以肯定你再也无法再次击中它，因为射击代码存在严重漏洞，连续三次射击同一位置会导致击中屏幕上三个完全不同的区域。这个问题真的是《射击街机》的致命缺陷，毁了一款原本可能很棒的游戏。如果你能克服有缺陷的瞄准系统，《射击街机》会非常有趣。看看程序员能从古老的雅达利2600游戏机中挖掘出多少潜力，是一件很有意思的事情。"

d071fbe984a3444ad74adb98c5d89903,Six Pack (USA) (Proto).zip,Unknown 20th Century Fox Game,20世纪福克斯未知游戏,"Believe me when I say that this prototype is a complete mystery.  No programmer, no model number, and only a guess on the company  We don't even know the name of the game.  The only we have as to the identity of this prototype is the name Universal, which is silk screened onto the EPROM board.  We now speculate that this might have been a TCF game as another Universal style board was recently found in a TCF prototype.  If this is indeed a TCF game then it might be the mysterious Six Pack that was mentioned in early manuals (based on the racing movie of the same name), however the drag racing aspect fits closer to the TCF movie Heart Like A Wheel (pat yourself on the back if you actually remember that movie).  The only flaw with this theory is that no game was ever announced for that movie. 
While we may never know the true identity of this game, it's a sure fire bet that it was meant to be a clone of Activision's Dragster (which is really a clone of Atari's Drag Race).  However unlike Dragster or Drag Race which are viewed from the side, this game is viewed from behind.  The perspective is similar to that of Activision's Enduro, right down to the vanishing point on the horizon.   It's immediately obvious from the graphics that a lot of work was being put into this game. 
As previously mentioned, this game is really just a clone of Dragster.  The player must rev his engine and change gears as fast as possible without blowing the engine.  However unlike Dragster the player actually has control over his car and can steer it around the lane.  The faster the player goes, the further the car will move into the horizon and the harder it is to keep from crashing into the sides of the lane.  Careful steering is a must if you're going to win a race in this game. 
The controls in this prototype are a bit screwy, and can easily frustrate someone who isn't familiar with them.  Starting the race is particularly annoying, as the player must press left, up, and right until the little man drops the white flag (or the light turns green).  Once the race has started, pressing up will cause the car to accelerate, while pressing down will change gears.  When pressing down the gear indicator will briefly change from N (Neutral) to C indicating that you are changing gears, continuing to press down will cause the car to shift into gears 1 through 4. 
As you increase your speed the meter at the bottom of the screen will show your current engine temperature.  If you go too fast in a low gear, your engine will blow.  By shifting gears at the proper time you will enable your car to move faster without blowing the engine.  Once you've reached the finish line, you must press the fire button to launch your parachute and slow your car down.  If you do not launch your parachute in time your car will crash.  Pressing the select button will enable the computer driver which takes over the first players spot (the car will turn yellow).  To race against the computer you will have to use the second players joystick.  There are three different computer components to race against, a yellow car, blue car, and finally a red car.  You will have to race the blue and yellow cars a few times in order to see the red car. 
There are two different racing variations available in this prototype, which can be selected by toggling the left difficulty switch. When the switch is in the A position the race takes place on a city street (which looks suspiciously like Sega's Turbo) with stock cars and a man with a white flag that starts the race.  When the switch is in the B position the race takes place out in the desert with dragsters and the race is started by an automatic light.  This is little difference between the two except the dragster variation moves faster than the stock car variation (the player must switch gears faster).  While it may appear that there is no one player option for the dragster variation, there actually is but you really have to work to get to it.  In order to get to the one player dragster race you must first beat all three opponents (yellow, blue, and red), and then you will start the next race in the desert. 
While it isn't the best game out there, this racing game show promise and it's mysterious nature simply adds to allure.  This prototype was auctioned off by Best Electronics in 2004, and released by Curt Vendel of the Atari History Museum on Atari Age for the classic gaming community to enjoy.","相信我，这款原型游戏完全是个谜。没有程序员信息，没有型号，对制作公司也只是猜测。我们甚至不知道游戏的名字。关于这款原型游戏身份的唯一线索是“环球”这个名字，它被丝印在EPROM板上。我们现在推测这可能是20世纪福克斯（TCF）的游戏，因为最近在一款20世纪福克斯的原型游戏中发现了另一块类似环球风格的电路板。如果这确实是20世纪福克斯的游戏，那么它可能就是早期手册中提到的神秘游戏《六连包》（基于同名赛车电影），不过其直线加速赛的元素更符合20世纪福克斯的电影《心如车轮》（如果你真的记得那部电影，就给自己点个赞吧）。这个理论的唯一缺陷是，从未有过为那部电影制作游戏的消息。
虽然我们可能永远无法知道这款游戏的真正身份，但可以肯定的是，它原本是想克隆动视的《直线加速赛车》（而《直线加速赛车》实际上又是克隆了雅达利的《直线加速赛》）。不过，与从侧面视角观看的《直线加速赛车》或《直线加速赛》不同，这款游戏是从后方视角观看的。其视角类似于动视的《耐力赛》，一直到地平线的消失点都是如此。从画面上可以立刻看出，为这款游戏投入了大量的工作。
如前所述，这款游戏实际上只是《直线加速赛车》的克隆版。玩家必须尽可能快地给发动机加速并换挡，同时不能让发动机过热。不过，与《直线加速赛车》不同的是，玩家实际上可以控制自己的汽车，并可以在车道上操控它。玩家开得越快，汽车在地平线上就会移动得越远，也就越难避免撞到车道两侧。如果你想在这款游戏中赢得比赛，小心操控是必须的。
这款原型游戏的操作有点古怪，对于不熟悉它们的人来说很容易感到沮丧。开始比赛尤其烦人，因为玩家必须按左、上、右方向键，直到小人放下白旗（或者灯变绿）。比赛开始后，按上方向键会让汽车加速，按下方向键会换挡。按下方向键时，挡位指示器会从N（空挡）短暂变为C，表示你正在换挡，继续按下方向键会让汽车依次换入1到4挡。
随着速度的增加，屏幕底部的仪表会显示你当前的发动机温度。如果你在低挡位开得太快，发动机就会过热。在适当的时候换挡，你就能让汽车开得更快而不会让发动机过热。一旦你到达终点线，你必须按下开火按钮打开降落伞，让汽车减速。如果你不及时打开降落伞，汽车就会撞毁。按下选择按钮会启用电脑驾驶员，它会接管第一个玩家的位置（汽车会变成黄色）。要与电脑比赛，你必须使用第二个玩家的操纵杆。有三种不同的电脑对手可供比赛，分别是黄色汽车、蓝色汽车，最后是红色汽车。你必须和蓝色和黄色汽车比赛几次才能遇到红色汽车。
这款原型游戏有两种不同的赛车模式，可以通过切换左边的难度开关来选择。当开关处于A位置时，比赛在城市街道上进行（看起来很像世嘉的《涡轮赛车》），使用普通汽车，由一个拿着白旗的人发令开始比赛。当开关处于B位置时，比赛在沙漠中进行，使用直线加速赛车，由自动信号灯发令开始比赛。这两种模式之间的区别不大，只是直线加速赛车模式比普通汽车模式速度更快（玩家必须更快地换挡）。虽然看起来直线加速赛车模式没有单人选项，但实际上是有的，不过你真的得费点劲才能进入。要进入单人直线加速赛车比赛，你必须先击败所有三个对手（黄色、蓝色和红色），然后你就会在沙漠中开始下一场比赛。
虽然这不是市面上最好的游戏，但这款赛车游戏显示出了潜力，它的神秘特质更是增添了魅力。这款原型游戏于2004年由最佳电子公司拍卖，后由雅达利历史博物馆的柯特·文德尔在雅达利时代网站上发布，供经典游戏爱好者欣赏。"

Your goal is to ski down a rigidly-defined mountain course lined with orange trees, rocks, and snow men.  Your skier is colorfully rendered and even uses his poles to turn from side-to-side.  I also like how the mountains in the distance slowly rise and fall.  You can adjust your speed as you glide down the vertically-scrolling screen while avoiding trees, rocks, frolicing deer, bobcats, and dancing bears.  Your score is constantly racking up depending on your velocity.  Adding challenge are jumps you need to perform over extended sections of gray muck.  You'll know a jump is about to happen when you reach a large batch of yellow snow.  I have to admit it feels satisfying when you nail a jump.  But much like Ski Hunt (Home Vision, 1983), Ski Run relies too much on luck.  There's virtually no time to react to oncoming obstacles, even when you try to control your speed.  Heck, just trying to stay within the confines of the course is a challenge.  You get 25 (!) lives but you'll be surprised how fast you blow through them.

dfa2f49dea1ed086038c494baca34838,Stellar Track (USA).zip,Stellar Track,星际轨道,"This is an Atari 2600 version of a Star Trek game found on many college mainframes.
Like those mainframe programs, it has no graphics, only text. You use the joystick, moving left or right, to select the command you want then press the red button. You then move the joystick left or right to select set the parameters of that command, if there are any. You start by pressing Reset or Select to choose how many enemies you must kill in how many stardates. 
The commands and any settings are as follows:
Galaxy Map=a 6x6 grid that starts out empty until you do a long range scan. Afterwards, the quadrants will show a 2 digit number. The left digit is the number of aliens in the area. The right digit will either be a 1 or a zero, depending on whether there is or is not a starbase in that area. Galaxy map costs you no energy or stardates.
LR Scan=Long range scan. This will tell you what is in your quadrant and all the quadrants next to yours. If there are any enemies in your quadrant when you do an LR scan, they will attack you. LR scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.
SR Scan=Short range scan. This shows you the stars, aliens and starbases in your quadrant. You need to do this to destroy aliens and dock with starbases. Like LR Scan, if there are aliens in your quadrant, they will attack after you use SR Scan. Also, like LR Scan, SR Scan does not cost energy or stardates but it does take a turn.
Warp=Warp is how you move, either from quadrant to quadrant or from sector to sector within a quadrant. You move by setting 2 settings. The first is your direction. You select a direction based on the numbers below:
8  1  2
  | /
7--*--3
 / | 
6  5  4
Next, you select how many quadrants and sectors to move. If you want to move within a quadrant, set the left number to zero so you don't warp out of that quadrant. Warp uses stardates, energy and a turn. If you warp into a quadrant that has only you and stars, the screen will be green. If you warp into a quadrant with aliens or aliens and a starbase, the screen will be red. If you warp into a quadrant with just the starbase, the screen will be gray. You cannot warp through stars. If you try, you lose the stardate and energy but don't go anywhere.
Photon Torpedo=If you hit an enemy with one of these, just one shot kills them. You select the direction with the same numbers as warp. there must be a clear line of sight between you and the enemy; no stars. You carry up to 9 torpedoes and they can be replenished.  Photon torpedoes do not cost energy or time, just a turn.
Phasers=Unlike photon torpedoes, you do not need to be directly in line of the enemy or tell the game where to fire. You just set how strong you want the blast to be, via a three digit number, and the computer fires. The closer you are to the enemy, the harder you hit. Phasers use the amount of energy from you as you fired. You also use a turn.
Status=A status report. This will tell you how many stardates, aliens, energy units and photon torpedoes are left and whether you have taken damage and to what. If you have taken damage, you will see a negative number next to the damaged item. This is how many stardates it will take to repair the item on your own. You cannot leave the quadrant if your engines are damaged. Instead, you must try to warp the number of quadrants that would take that much time. You won't go anywhere but you will repair.
If you dock at a starbase, you are instantly repaired of all damage, refueled and torpedoes are restocked. Starbases are placed randomly in the galaxy and never move or get destroyed. There are always two per galaxy. To dock, warp to the quadrant and sector where the base is, so you over the top of it.
Skill (Difficulty) switches
The right switch controls how easily you take damage. In the Expert (A) position, your chance of taking damage is twice as likely as in the Novice (B) position.
The left switch controls phaser strength. In the Novice (B) position, your phasers are twice as strong as the aliens'. In the Expert (A) position, your phasers are the same strength as the aliens'.","这是一款在许多大学大型机上都能找到的《星际迷航》游戏的雅达利2600版本。
和那些大型机程序一样，它没有图形界面，只有文本。你使用操纵杆左右移动来选择你想要的指令，然后按下红色按钮。如果指令有参数，你再使用操纵杆左右移动来选择并设置这些参数。游戏开始时，你可以按下重置或选择按钮，来选择你必须在多少个星际日期内消灭多少个敌人。
指令及其设置如下：
星系地图 = 一个6x6的网格，在你进行远距离扫描之前，它是空白的。扫描之后，各个象限会显示一个两位数。左边的数字表示该区域的外星人数。右边的数字要么是1，要么是0，分别表示该区域是否有星际基地。查看星系地图不消耗能量和星际日期。
远距离扫描（LR Scan） = 进行远距离扫描。这会告诉你所在象限以及相邻所有象限的情况。如果你在进行远距离扫描时，所在象限有敌人，他们会攻击你。远距离扫描不消耗能量和星际日期，但会占用一回合。
近距离扫描（SR Scan） = 进行近距离扫描。这会显示你所在象限的恒星、外星人和星际基地。你需要进行此操作来消灭外星人和停靠星际基地。和远距离扫描一样，如果你所在象限有外星人，在你使用近距离扫描后，他们会攻击你。同样，近距离扫描也不消耗能量和星际日期，但会占用一回合。
曲速飞行（Warp） = 这是你移动的方式，可以从一个象限移动到另一个象限，也可以在一个象限内从一个区域移动到另一个区域。你通过设置两个参数来移动。第一个是方向。你根据以下数字选择方向：
8  1  2
  | /
7--*--3
 / | 
6  5  4
接下来，你选择要移动的象限和区域数量。如果你想在一个象限内移动，将左边的数字设为0，这样你就不会跳出该象限。曲速飞行会消耗星际日期、能量并占用一回合。如果你曲速飞行到一个只有你和恒星的象限，屏幕会变成绿色。如果你曲速飞行到一个有外星人或有外星人和星际基地的象限，屏幕会变成红色。如果你曲速飞行到一个只有星际基地的象限，屏幕会变成灰色。你不能穿过恒星进行曲速飞行。如果你尝试这样做，你会损失星际日期和能量，但不会移动到任何地方。
光子鱼雷（Photon Torpedo） = 如果你用其中一枚击中敌人，只需一发就能消灭他们。你用和曲速飞行相同的数字来选择方向。你和敌人之间必须有清晰的视线，不能有恒星阻挡。你最多可以携带9枚鱼雷，并且可以补充。光子鱼雷不消耗能量或时间，只占用一回合。
相位炮（Phasers） = 与光子鱼雷不同，你不需要直接对准敌人，也不需要告诉游戏往哪里开火。你只需通过一个三位数设置你想要的爆炸强度，然后电脑就会开火。你离敌人越近，攻击就越猛烈。相位炮会消耗你发射时所设置的能量，同时也会占用一回合。
状态（Status） = 一份状态报告。这会告诉你还剩下多少星际日期、外星人、能量单位和光子鱼雷，以及你是否受到了损伤和损伤的部位。如果你受到了损伤，你会在受损物品旁边看到一个负数。这表示你自行修复该物品需要的星际日期数。如果你的引擎受损，你就不能离开该象限。相反，你必须尝试曲速飞行相当于修复所需时间的象限数。你不会移动到任何地方，但你的引擎会得到修复。
如果你停靠在星际基地，你所有的损伤会立即修复，燃料会加满，鱼雷也会重新补充。星际基地随机分布在星系中，不会移动或被摧毁。每个星系总是有两个星际基地。要停靠，曲速飞行到基地所在的象限和区域，使你位于其上方。
技能（难度）开关
右边的开关控制你受到损伤的难易程度。在专家（A）模式下，你受到损伤的几率是新手（B）模式下的两倍。
左边的开关控制相位炮的强度。在新手（B）模式下，你的相位炮强度是外星人的两倍。在专家（A）模式下，你的相位炮强度和外星人的相同。"

5aa51c94e65ea02d131318399a1246d0,Stunt Cycle (USA) (Proto).zip,Stunt Cycle,特技摩托,"Stunt Cycle was one of Atari's first ""Non-Pong"" standalone consoles, and was based off the Atari coin-op of the same name.  The console consisted of a set of handlebar grips, which you could use to make your cycle move faster or slower and a fire button used to make you jump.  The gameplay revolves around making your ""Stunt Cycle"" jump over cars (ala Evil Knievel) and land safely on the other side without flying off the end of the screen.  Your cycle starts at the top of the screen, where you are given two ""rows"" of screen space to build up speed before hitting the ramp at the bottom.  The ""trick"" to the game is to build up enough speed to jump over the cars, but not too much that you go crashing off the edge of the screen.  If you successfully make the jump the row of cars gets wider and you have to go back and jump it again. 
It is interesting to note that the arcade version has your cycle move through 'tubes' on the sides of the screen between rows whereas the home console version does not.  This means that in the arcade your cycle moves left to right across the first row, then RIGHT to LEFT across the second row before moving left to right again on the bottom.  This is a bit more realistic (well as realistic as motorcycle blasting through invisible tubes on the sides of the screen can be anyway) but can mess with your head if you're not expecting it.  The home console and 2600 port simply has the player 'warp' back to the left side of the screen when he reaches the end, meaning you always travel left to right on each row. 
Sometime in 1980 Atari decided that Stunt Cycle would make a great 2600 game, so Bob Polaro was tapped to do the conversion.  Using the paddle controllers to simulate the original consoles bike grips, Bob made a near perfect port of the standalone console.  One change that was made to the game was the addition of color.  Since the original coin-op and home console were from 1976, the graphics were in Black and White which was standard at the time.  However Atari 2600 games had to have the option of color or B&W, some color was added to the game (although not much) to spruce it up.  After a few months of programming, Stunt Cycle was finished and ready to go. 
It was around this time that marketing had ""brilliant"" idea; why not make Stunt Cycle into a Dukes of Hazzard game?  So Bob went back to work retooling the graphics to fit the new Dukes of Hazzard theme.  The cycle was changed into the General Lee, while the row of cars was changed into a lake.  The colors were brightened up a little and some Dukes of Hazzard theme music was also added to the game to complete the illusion. So after a few more months of tinkering, the new Dukes of Hazzard version of Stunt Cycle was good to go.  However by this point (late 1980/early 1981) the game was starting to look a bit dated so management decided that a completely new version would be better.  So programmer Mark Hahn of the Atari NY field office was tapped to do a new Dukes of Hazzard game from scratch which was also never released. 
So after a few more months of tinkering, the new Dukes of Hazzard version of Stunt Cycle was good to go, but there was a problem.  Cleaver playtesters soon realized that you could change the speed on the car in mid-air!  This means you could go full blast at the ramp and then slow down suddenly after you've made the jump, but before you've landed.  This basically took the challenge out of the whole game, making it fairly boring.  After Dukes of Hazzard was shelved, programmer Mark Hahn was then tapped to do a totally new Dukes of Hazzard game from scratch (which was never released either). 
Stunt Cycle/Dukes of Hazzard has a few interesting options to keep the game fresh.  The first three variations allow the player to not worry about skidding out and change their speed mid-air during jumps, this is basically the 'easy' version of the game.  The second three variations are the 'pro' mode where players must watch their speed on turns (the invisible tubes on the edges of the screen) or they will skid out and crash, you also cannot change your speed during jumps in these variations.  The final three variations are a combination of the two modes in which you can still skid out, but you can also change your speed in mid-air.  The difficulty switches also control how large the landing zone will be. 
Did Atari make the right decision in canceling Stunt Cycle?  This is a hard question to answer since it's unknown what Atari's original motives were.  Had Stunt Cycle been released in 1980 as a color port of the coin-op it probably would have been very successful since people who bought it would have known what they were getting, and wouldn't mind the blocky graphics, which were standard for that time.  Had Atari released it as Dukes of Hazzard a year later, people would have probably felt gypped as it wouldn't be long before they realized that the game was nothing more than Stunt Cycle with new graphics.  Atari made the right decision in not releasing the updated Dukes of Hazzard version, but screwed up by not releasing the original Stunt Cycle version.  Chalk this one up to another act of Atari mismanagement. 
Strangely Stunt Cycle was never mentioned in any Atari catalogs, and was never assigned a product number.","特技摩托是雅达利早期的“非乒乓”独立游戏机游戏之一，它基于雅达利同名街机游戏开发。该游戏机配备了一组车把式手柄，你可以用它来控制摩托加速或减速，还有一个射击按钮用于让摩托跳跃。

游戏玩法围绕着让你的“特技摩托”像埃维尔·克尼维尔那样跳过汽车，并安全地落在另一边，同时避免飞出屏幕边缘。摩托从屏幕顶部开始，在到达底部的斜坡前，你有两个“行”的屏幕空间来加速。游戏的“诀窍”是积累足够的速度跳过汽车，但又不能太快，以免冲出屏幕边缘。如果你成功跳过，那排汽车会变得更宽，你就得返回再次跳跃。

值得注意的是，街机版中，摩托在每行之间会通过屏幕两侧的“管道”移动，而家用机版则没有这个设定。这意味着在街机上，摩托先从左到右穿过第一行，然后从右到左穿过第二行，最后再从左到右穿过底部那行。这稍微更逼真一些（嗯，就像摩托在屏幕两侧的隐形管道中飞驰能达到的那种逼真程度），但如果你没料到这一点，可能会让你晕头转向。家用机版和雅达利2600移植版中，玩家到达屏幕尽头时会直接“传送”回屏幕左侧，这意味着你在每行上总是从左到右移动。

1980年的某个时候，雅达利认为《特技摩托》会是一款很棒的雅达利2600游戏，于是让鲍勃·波拉罗进行移植。鲍勃用桨式控制器模拟原版游戏机的车把，几乎完美地将独立游戏机版移植了过来。游戏做的一个改动是增加了色彩。由于原版街机和家用机是1976年的产品，当时的图形是黑白的，这在当时很常见。然而，雅达利2600游戏必须有彩色或黑白的选项，所以游戏中添加了一些色彩（虽然不多）来让它更出彩。经过几个月的编程，《特技摩托》完成并准备推出。

就在这时，营销部门有了一个“绝妙”的主意：为什么不把《特技摩托》改成《豪斯的冒险》主题的游戏呢？于是鲍勃又回去重新调整图形，以适应新的《豪斯的冒险》主题。摩托改成了“李将军号”汽车，那排汽车改成了一片湖。颜色稍微变亮了一些，还添加了《豪斯的冒险》的主题音乐，以营造出完整的氛围。经过几个月的调整，新版《豪斯的冒险》主题的《特技摩托》可以推出了。然而，到了这个时候（1980年末/1981年初），这款游戏看起来有点过时了，所以管理层认为做一个全新版本会更好。于是，雅达利纽约分公司的程序员马克·哈恩被要求从头开始制作一款新的《豪斯的冒险》游戏，但这款游戏也从未发布。

经过几个月的调整，新版《豪斯的冒险》主题的《特技摩托》可以推出了，但出现了一个问题。聪明的测试玩家很快发现，你可以在空中改变汽车的速度！这意味着你可以在冲向斜坡时全力加速，然后在跳跃后、落地前突然减速。这基本上让整个游戏失去了挑战性，变得相当无聊。《豪斯的冒险》版被搁置后，程序员马克·哈恩又被要求从头开始制作一款全新的《豪斯的冒险》游戏（这款游戏也从未发布）。

《特技摩托/豪斯的冒险》有几个有趣的选项来保持游戏的新鲜感。前三种模式让玩家不必担心滑倒，并且可以在跳跃时在空中改变速度，这基本上是游戏的“简单”版本。接下来的三种模式是“专业”模式，玩家在转弯时（屏幕边缘的隐形管道处）必须注意速度，否则就会滑倒并坠毁，而且在这些模式中你不能在跳跃时改变速度。最后的三种模式是前两种模式的结合，你仍然可能滑倒，但也可以在空中改变速度。难度开关还可以控制着陆区域的大小。

雅达利取消《特技摩托》的发行是正确的决定吗？这是一个很难回答的问题，因为不清楚雅达利最初的动机是什么。如果《特技摩托》在1980年作为街机版的彩色移植版发行，可能会非常成功，因为购买它的人知道自己会得到什么，而且不会介意当时很常见的方块图形。如果雅达利一年后以《豪斯的冒险》的名义发行，人们可能会觉得被骗了，因为不久之后他们就会意识到这款游戏只不过是换了新图形的《特技摩托》。雅达利不发行更新后的《豪斯的冒险》版是正确的决定，但没有发行原版《特技摩托》版就搞砸了。这可以归咎于雅达利的又一次管理失误。

奇怪的是，《特技摩托》从未在雅达利的任何产品目录中被提及，也从未被分配产品编号。"

The Mindlink was a headband that player wore on his head and plugged into the joystick port.  The idea was that the Mindlink's sensors would pick up any facial movements or muscle twitches the player would make.  Atari actually said that the Mindlink read the player's thoughts (sure it did...).  The problem was that the Mindlink didn't work very well in initial test runs, and even when it did work players would complain of headaches and dizziness from twitching their face all day.  After disappointing test results, the Mindlink controller was wisely canceled. 
Telepathy was actually developed as a demo to show what kind games the Mindlink could do.  This ""demo"" is made up of seven different action screens held together by a loose ""mine"" theme.  Thankfully Telepathy is playable without the Mindlink controller (unlike Bionic Breakthrough) by pressing the joystick button.  It's unknown if Atari was thinking of releasing Telepathy sans Mindlink or if the joystick code was put in the game for playtesting purposes. 
Unlike most games of the time, Telepathy has a demo mode which will run through all the screens if the game is left untouched.  Interestingly you can control the player in the demo using the joystick, it's unknown if this was intentional or just a bug.  The game starts off with a really cool sign which descends from the top of the screen telling you which mine your on.  After that you're whisked off to the first screen. 
-The Plain- 
This is the oddest screen in the whole game, because it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the rest of the screens.  You control a large white man with antennas sticking out of his head.  You must guide the man over the glowing triangles as he walks along the plain.  The glowing triangles appear in a weaving line (like a trail of bread crumbs) and will eventually lead to a large hole in the ground.  Each glowing triangle is initially worth 5 points, but each successive triangle you collect is worth an addition 5 points (5, 10, 15, 20, etc.).  If you miss a triangle the point value starts back over at 5.  The controls on this level are a bit strange, as the man will always want to move to the far left side of the screen.  You must struggle to keep him moving on the proper path, collecting triangles as he goes.  As you get to the higher mines the amount of triangles and the speed at which you walk increase.  The pattern of the triangles will also become more twisted and harder to follow.  Once you reach the hole at the end of the path you are taken to the spider screen. 
-Spiders- 
This is the first level in the mine itself.  Your guy is now a small Indiana Jones looking character instead of the large man with the antennas.  Your character looks so much like Indiana Jones in fact that some people initially speculated that this prototype was really Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (this was before the names on the EPROM's were known).  The goal of this level is to run past the spiders and get to the hole at the bottom of the screen before the timer runs out.  If you get hit by one of the spiders, you start over at the top of the screen and lose a life.  The spiders are fast and hard to avoid because they bounce around the screen, but you can always find a safe zone at the edges of each ledge.  You can either run (your normal mode of transportation) or walk by holding down the fire button.  Walking allows you to move more accurately, but since it's speed that counts you'll want to run to the exit.  You have 15 seconds to complete this level, but since the timer counts in tenths of a second it starts at 1500.  From here on every time you complete a level you'll get 100 points for each second left on timer.  In the higher mines the spiders are faster and move more erratically. 
-Elevators- 
This level starts to appear beginning in mine 2.  The board structure is very similar to the spider level, but instead of avoiding spiders you need to avoid moving elevator platforms.  If your man happens to bump into a moving platform he'll be thrown back a bit, but if he steps onto one he'll be transported back to the top of the elevator.  Since time is short anything that keeps you from getting to the screen is bad, even if it's not deadly.  For some reason the holes in the ledges have been replaced by white hatches, but they function the same way.  In later mines the speed of the elevators increases dramatically. 
-Ledges- 
This level begins to appear starting in mine 3.  You must carefully maneuver you man as he falls from ledge to ledge, avoiding the fireballs being shot from the sides of the mine.  The fireballs move with blinding speed, and with your slow rate of decent there is almost time to avoid them.  You can tell where the fireballs are about come from by looking for the red glow around the rocks on the sides of the screen.  The best strategy for this level is to land on each ledge and wait for the next fireball to launch before continuing.  In later mines the ledges begin to move making things even more difficult. 
-The Mashers- 
This level starts to appear from mine 4 onward.  At first glance the level appears to be empty, but suddenly large mashers will quickly descend and retract from the ceiling.  Timing is crucial on this level as the mashers are very fast and are invisible until they descend from the ceiling.  As always, your goal is to reach the bottom of the screen before the timer runs out. 
-The Miner- 
This level is rather simple.  After your man falls down the shaft you can either walk over to the left and save the stranded miner (ala HERO), or exit to the right and forget the miner.  Grabbing the miner doesn't seem to do anything, but since this is the goal of the game it would be dumb not to.  If you choose to rescue the miner you can levitate out of the hole by pushing against the wall.  There are large boulders which fall down from the top of the shaft, but they're slow so they don't pose much of a threat (although the speed does increase with each mine). 
-The River- 
This is always the last level in each mine.  On this level you must move your man through the gaps in the river walls while avoiding the deadly piranha.  The controls are similar to the Plain level as you man will constantly move to the left unless you keep pushing the joystick to the right.  Your man will automatically move through the gaps in the river when he is in front of them, but since the level is constantly scrolling forward this is a good thing.  If you get bumped off the bottom of the screen or touch a piranha your man will be killed and you'll have to start the level over.  The higher the mine level, the faster the fish and scrolling become.  If you complete this level you will be transported to the next mine. 
It's unknown if Atari actually ever planned to turn Telepathy into a commercial game, but as it stands it's one hell of a demo.  It's hard to believe that these mini-games would work well with the hard to use Mindlink controller, as they require pin point precision, constant movement, and other things that the Mindlink didn't do well.  They do however work quite well with the joystick, which may be why that code was added.  So fire up the emulator and enjoy Telepathy, the best game that never was.","《心灵感应》是为雅达利失败的Mindlink控制器开发的两款已知原型游戏之一。Mindlink是一个头带，玩家将其戴在头上，并插入游戏手柄端口。其原理是，Mindlink的传感器会捕捉玩家的任何面部动作或肌肉抽搐。实际上，雅达利声称Mindlink能读取玩家的思想（当然是瞎扯……）。问题在于，Mindlink在最初的测试运行中效果不佳，而且即使它能正常工作，玩家也会抱怨整天面部抽搐导致头痛和头晕。由于测试结果令人失望，Mindlink控制器被明智地取消了。
《心灵感应》实际上是作为一个演示开发的，用于展示Mindlink能支持什么样的游戏。这个“演示”由七个不同的动作画面组成，以一个松散的“矿井”主题串联在一起。值得庆幸的是，与《仿生突破》不同，《心灵感应》无需Mindlink控制器，通过按下游戏手柄按钮就可以玩。目前尚不清楚雅达利是否考虑过在没有Mindlink的情况下发布《心灵感应》，还是为了测试目的在游戏中加入了手柄控制代码。
与当时的大多数游戏不同，《心灵感应》有一个演示模式，如果不操作游戏，它会自动运行所有画面。有趣的是，你可以在演示中使用游戏手柄控制玩家，目前尚不清楚这是有意为之还是一个漏洞。游戏开始时，会有一个非常酷的标志从屏幕顶部降下，告诉你所在的矿井编号。之后，你就会进入第一个画面。
- 平原 - 
这是整个游戏中最奇怪的画面，因为它似乎与其他画面的主题不太相符。你控制一个头上伸出天线的大白人。当他在平原上行走时，你必须引导他走过发光的三角形。发光的三角形呈蜿蜒的线条排列（就像面包屑的痕迹），最终会通向地面上的一个大洞。每个发光的三角形最初价值5分，但你每收集一个连续的三角形，其价值就会增加5分（5分、10分、15分、20分等）。如果你错过一个三角形，分数就会重新从5分开始计算。这一关的控制有点奇怪，因为这个人总是想移动到屏幕的最左边。你必须努力让他沿着正确的路径移动，边走边收集三角形。随着你进入更高等级的矿井，三角形的数量和你行走的速度都会增加。三角形的排列模式也会变得更加扭曲，更难跟随。一旦你到达路径尽头的洞，你就会进入蜘蛛关卡。
- 蜘蛛 - 
这是矿井内的第一关。你的角色现在变成了一个看起来像印第安纳·琼斯的小个子，而不是那个头上有天线的大个子。事实上，你的角色看起来非常像印第安纳·琼斯，以至于有些人最初猜测这个原型实际上是《夺宝奇兵2：魔域奇兵》（这是在EPROM上的名称被知晓之前）。这一关的目标是在计时器归零之前，跑过蜘蛛，到达屏幕底部的洞。如果你被其中一只蜘蛛击中，你将从屏幕顶部重新开始，并失去一条生命。蜘蛛速度很快，而且很难躲避，因为它们在屏幕上四处弹跳，但你总能在每个岩架的边缘找到安全区域。你可以跑步（这是你正常的移动方式），也可以按住射击按钮步行。步行可以让你移动得更准确，但由于速度很重要，你会想尽快跑到出口。你有15秒的时间完成这一关，但由于计时器以十分之一秒为单位计数，所以它从1500开始。从这里开始，每次你完成一关，你将根据计时器上剩余的秒数获得每秒钟100分的奖励。在更高等级的矿井中，蜘蛛的速度更快，移动也更不稳定。
- 电梯 - 
这一关从第二个矿井开始出现。关卡结构与蜘蛛关卡非常相似，但你需要躲避的不是蜘蛛，而是移动的电梯平台。如果你的角色碰巧撞到一个移动的平台，他会被稍微弹回一点，但如果他踏上一个平台，他会被送回电梯顶部。由于时间紧迫，任何阻碍你到达屏幕底部的事情都是不利的，即使它不会致命。出于某种原因，岩架上的洞被白色舱口取代了，但它们的功能是一样的。在后续的矿井中，电梯的速度会显著增加。
- 岩架 - 
这一关从第三个矿井开始出现。当你的角色从一个岩架落到另一个岩架时，你必须小心地操控他，躲避从矿井两侧射出的火球。火球的移动速度极快，而你下落的速度很慢，几乎没有时间躲避它们。你可以通过观察屏幕两侧岩石周围的红光，判断火球将从哪里射出。这一关的最佳策略是落在每个岩架上，等待下一个火球发射后再继续前进。在后续的矿井中，岩架会开始移动，这使得情况变得更加困难。
- 碾压机 - 
这一关从第四个矿井开始出现。乍一看，这一关似乎是空的，但突然会有巨大的碾压机从天花板快速降下并缩回。在这一关，时机至关重要，因为碾压机速度非常快，而且在从天花板降下之前是看不见的。和往常一样，你的目标是在计时器归零之前到达屏幕底部。
- 矿工 - 
这一关相当简单。当你的角色从竖井落下后，你可以向左走，去拯救被困的矿工（就像《英雄》那样），或者向右走，不管那个矿工。抓住矿工似乎没有什么作用，但既然这是游戏的目标，不这么做就太傻了。如果你选择拯救矿工，你可以通过靠墙推来悬浮出洞。有大石块从竖井顶部落下，但它们速度很慢，所以不会构成太大威胁（不过，随着矿井等级的提高，速度会增加）。
- 河流 - 
这总是每个矿井的最后一关。在这一关，你必须让你的角色穿过河壁的缝隙，同时躲避致命的食人鱼。控制方式与平原关卡类似，因为你的角色会一直向左移动，除非你一直将游戏手柄向右推。当你的角色面对河壁的缝隙时，他会自动穿过它们，但由于关卡一直在向前滚动，这是件好事。如果你从屏幕底部掉下去或碰到食人鱼，你的角色就会死亡，你必须重新开始这一关。矿井等级越高，鱼的速度和关卡滚动的速度就越快。如果你完成了这一关，你将被传送到下一个矿井。
目前尚不清楚雅达利是否真的计划将《心灵感应》变成一款商业游戏，但就目前而言，它是一个非常棒的演示。很难相信这些小游戏能与难以使用的Mindlink控制器配合得很好，因为它们需要精确的操作、持续的移动，而这些都是Mindlink做得不好的地方。然而，它们与游戏手柄配合得相当好，这可能就是为什么加入了手柄控制代码。所以，启动模拟器，享受《心灵感应》这款从未真正问世的最佳游戏吧。"
0d779f7363c613edb7eb8b713a68dc80,Tempest (USA) (Proto) (Atari Anthology).zip,Tempest,时空风暴,"On the list of games that probably should never have been tried on the 2600, Tempest has to be near the top.  Why Atari decided they could reproduce a 3D vector game on the 2600 is beyond me, but the results weren't pretty.  Sometimes one has to respect the limitations of the 2600. 
I've said it once and I'll say it again; If there's one thing the 2600 doesn't do well it's diagonals.  Unfortunately Tempest is chockfull of diagonals as the tubes angle out from the center of the screen to form complex geometric patterns.  This leads us to the next problem, if there's a second thing the 2600 doesn't do well it's complex geometric patterns!  The 2600 version gets around this by not having 3D tubes, but rather a flat looking shape (often jokingly compared to a pair of woman's underware) with the enemies coming from one side and the player moving on the other.  For some reason the board seems to flux and change a bit as things move around the screen, this is probably the result of a programming glitch.  The board  s segmented into what could be called tubes (if you use your imagination), but these ""tubes"" don't seem to correspond to where the real tubes (which are invisible) are. 
This brings us to the next problem, if there's a third thing the 2600 doesn't do well and it's 3D perspective.  Atari couldn't get around this one; the 3D perspective is what makes Tempest ""Tempest"".  Atari tried to simulate this by changing the enemy's size to make it look like it was getting closer.  Unfortunately there aren't nearly enough frames of animation to do this, so the enemies sort of jump forward in an awkward fashion.  The enemy graphics are very blocky and becomes even more evident as the size is increased when they approach the outer edge of the tube.  This combined with a very blocky looking ""shape"" for the board makes for one ugly looking game. 
Amazingly, even with the 2600's limitations, there are four different types of enemies present in this version. 
Flippers -- These are the little bowtie shaped guys who are the main enemy of the game.  They're not dangerous until they reach the top of the tube and start coming after you. 
Flipper Tankers -- These will break into two Flippers when hit. 
Pulsars -- These guys are dangerous!  They will electrocute the tube they're in every now and then killing you instantly if you're on it.  In this version the tube doesn't light up when electrocuted, but the Pulsar itself will glow a second before, warning you to beware. 
Fuseballs -- These fun little guys are similar to Flippers but they only zip up and down the tube they're in. 
The controls in this early version are often very frustrating.  There appear to be set places where your blaster can move to (hidden tubes), but they don't seem to correspond to the shape on the screen.  This wouldn't be so bad if they were at regular intervals, but they seem to be very close together towards the middle of the screen and very far apart near the edges (a side effect of mirroring the playfield).  This makes lining up your shots with the incoming enemies very difficult because you're not quite sure where the next ""hidden tube"" is.  This coupled with the fact that the ""jumping"" enemies move very quickly up the short tubes makes for a very difficult game.  The firing is a bit off as well, and it appears that your blaster will fire towards the left side of it's graphic instead of from the middle.  This wouldn't be so bad if the bullets didn't have a bad habit of disappearing when too many object are on the screen (probably due to flicker), this can lead to some mysterious deaths from invisible bullets.  Thankfully you have your Super Zapper in this version, which can be activated by pressing up and fire. 
In the programmers defense, they did a wonderful job on Tempest considering she was attempting to do the impossible. But while a game technically can be done on the 2600, doesn't necessarily mean it should be (see Double Dragon for another example).  Also, since this version isn't complete, it's really not fair to start judging it yet.  Given some time, I'm sure a much more playable version with improved graphics and smother gameplay could have been put together.  While it probably wouldn't have ever looked like its arcade counterpart, this prototype proves that Tempest could (in a very limited fashion) be done on the 2600.  A later version with some added features like a title screen was reviewed in Ultimate Gamer magazine, but it's unknown what happened to that prototype. 
The name of the programmer for the 2600 version of Tempest has been a bit of a mystery.  Carla Meninsky has generally been identified as the programmer, but some other programmers seem to recall that someone else worked on Tempest.  Carla herself shed some light on this when she mentioned that the prototype we have isn't her version at all.  More digging shows that the current prototype (dated 1-5-84) was made long after Carla had left Atari. So it appears that Atari decided to assign another programmer to make a new version of Tempest after Carla left rather than use her existing code.  Unfortunately, Carla's original version remains lost and the identity of the programmer behind this version remains a mystery.","在那些可能永远不应该在雅达利2600游戏机上尝试的游戏名单中，《时空风暴》肯定名列前茅。我实在不明白雅达利为何决定要在2600上重现一款3D矢量游戏，而且结果并不理想。有时候，人们必须尊重2600的性能局限。
我曾经说过，现在还要再说一遍；如果说2600有一样东西处理得不好，那就是斜线。不幸的是，《时空风暴》里满是斜线，因为管道从屏幕中心向外倾斜，形成复杂的几何图案。这就引出了下一个问题，如果说2600还有一样东西处理得不好，那就是复杂的几何图案！2600版的游戏绕过了这个问题，它没有3D管道，而是采用了一个看起来扁平的形状（常被戏称为女人的内衣），敌人从一侧出现，玩家在另一侧移动。出于某种原因，当屏幕上的物体移动时，游戏画面似乎会有些波动和变化，这可能是编程故障导致的。游戏画面被分割成可以被称为管道的部分（如果你发挥一下想象力的话），但这些“管道”似乎与实际的管道（是看不见的）位置并不对应。
这又引出了下一个问题，如果说2600还有一样东西处理得不好，那就是3D透视效果。雅达利无法解决这个问题；3D透视效果正是《时空风暴》成为《时空风暴》的关键所在。雅达利试图通过改变敌人的大小来模拟这种效果，让它们看起来像是在靠近。不幸的是，动画帧数远远不够，所以敌人向前移动的样子很笨拙。敌人的图形非常粗糙，当它们接近管道外边缘、尺寸变大时，这种情况就更加明显。再加上游戏画面那粗糙的“形状”，使得整个游戏看起来非常丑陋。
令人惊讶的是，尽管有2600的性能局限，这个版本中仍然有四种不同类型的敌人。
翻转怪——这些是呈领结形状的小家伙，是游戏中的主要敌人。在它们到达管道顶部并开始追你之前，它们并不危险。
翻转怪母舰——被击中时，它们会分裂成两个翻转怪。
脉冲星怪——这些家伙很危险！它们会时不时地对所在的管道放电，如果你在管道上，就会立即被电死。在这个版本中，管道被电击时不会发光，但脉冲星怪本身会提前一秒发光，提醒你小心。
熔球怪——这些有趣的小家伙和翻转怪类似，但它们只会在所在的管道里上下移动。
这个早期版本的操作常常让人非常沮丧。你的激光炮似乎只能移动到一些特定的位置（隐藏管道），但这些位置似乎与屏幕上的形状并不对应。如果这些位置间隔均匀，那倒也还好，但它们在屏幕中间似乎靠得很近，而在边缘则相距很远（这是游戏画面镜像处理的副作用）。这使得你很难将射击目标与来袭的敌人对齐，因为你不太确定下一个“隐藏管道”在哪里。再加上“跳跃”的敌人在短管道中移动得非常快，使得游戏变得非常难。射击也有点不准，看起来你的激光炮会朝着其图形的左侧开火，而不是从中间开火。如果屏幕上物体太多时子弹不会莫名其妙地消失（可能是因为闪烁问题），那倒也还好，这可能会导致一些被隐形子弹击中而神秘死亡的情况。值得庆幸的是，在这个版本中你有超级电击枪，按下上方向键和射击键就可以激活它。
为程序员说句公道话，考虑到他们试图完成不可能的任务，他们在《时空风暴》上已经做得非常出色了。但是，虽然从技术上来说可以在2600上开发这款游戏，但这并不一定意味着就应该这么做（看看《双截龙》就是另一个例子）。此外，由于这个版本并不完整，现在就开始评判它还不太公平。假以时日，我相信可以制作出一个画面更好、玩法更流畅、更具可玩性的版本。虽然它可能永远无法像街机版那样，但这个原型证明了《时空风暴》可以（在非常有限的程度上）在2600上实现。后来有一个增加了标题画面等功能的版本在《终极玩家》杂志上有过评测，但那个原型后来怎么样了就不得而知了。
雅达利2600版《时空风暴》的程序员是谁一直有点神秘。卡拉·梅宁斯基通常被认为是程序员，但其他一些程序员似乎记得还有其他人参与了《时空风暴》的开发。卡拉自己透露了一些情况，她提到我们现在看到的原型根本不是她的版本。进一步调查发现，目前的原型（日期是1984年1月5日）是在卡拉离开雅达利很久之后制作的。所以看起来雅达利在卡拉离开后决定指派另一名程序员制作一个新的《时空风暴》版本，而不是使用她现有的代码。不幸的是，卡拉的原始版本仍然下落不明，这个版本的程序员身份也仍然是个谜。"

3dcb754b39983399ba11a916d2102c81,Thwocker (USA) (Proto).zip,Thwocker,击乐手,"Thwocker is a game as strange as its name.  Written by Charlie Heath (of Reactor fame), Thwocker was described as ""Joust with musical instruments"".  While this isn't a bad description, it really doesn't illustrate all the gameplay elements that make Thwocker such an interesting game.  You control a little conductor (who happens to look like a bowling ball) who must bounce around a maze collecting musical notes for his song.  Along the way you must avoid various musical instruments that are out to get you (can't we all just get along?).  However you can't go grabbing just any musical notes, you must collect them in the proper order.  The current note type needed is shown at the bottom of the screen.  If you touch the wrong type of note you will ricochet off it, send your conductor flying across the screen (usually into a waiting enemy).  After collecting all the notes you must grab the treble clef symbol at the top of the maze to start the song.  Once the song starts to play your character will be able to touch enemies and notes for points (think of it as a power pellet) until the song ends.  After completing the song you can exit the level by touching the exit square. 
The controls in Thwocker take a little getting use to, but they're not as tricky as they first seem.  The levels seem to be made out of some kind of springy material, so your character bounces all around the screen.  You can control how high you bounce by pushing up and down.  Pushing down will make the conductor take little bounces, while pressing up (as you touch the ground) will make him bounce really high.  You can stop bouncing all together by pressing the fire button, which will make the conductor sort of ""skip"" across the level.  You will need to master all these bouncing techniques to successfully complete the level. 
Sadly Thwocker is incomplete as there is no way to exit the level.  It was thought that they player simply needed to touch the exit square after completing the song to finish the level, but this does not appear to be the case.  It appears that the code that allows you to destroy the enemy after completing the song also allows you to destroy the exit, so the game appears to be unwinnable.  However after careful examination of the game code, it appears there may be more to Thwocker than meets the eye.  Apparently the player must somehow ""combine"" the two voices of the song after it starts playing to exit the level.  Unfortunately we haven't figured out how this portion of the game works yet, but it may have something to do with picking up certain objects on the screen.  However just because the code to exit the level exists doesn't mean it's actually possible to do it in the game, so Thwocker may still be unwinnable after all. 
Thankfully you can still see the other levels by selecting the higher difficulty levels at the title screen.  Programmer Charlie Heath (who owns the only other known prototype) has said that Thwocker is only around 80% complete when development was cancelled.  One has to wonder what else Charlie had in store for us, as other than the lack of the ability to finish a level Thwocker seems fully playable and complete.  Perhaps there were some minor game or difficulty issues left to work out?  The only glitch I've seen in the game is on the game select screen.  The game number should go from 1 to 10, but there are six games in between 9 and 10.  These game numbers are represented by a space, another space, a white eigth note, a space, a white quarter note, and a dot.  This is most likely because the game numbers are stored in hex (base 16), so there are 16 games represented.  It is unknown if Charlie actually intended for there to be 16 games or only 10, but since they all seem to be playable one comes to the conclusion that they were indeed planned. 
Thwocker, along with Kabobber, were victims of the collapsing videogame market in 1984.  It was around this time that Activision decided it was time to get out of the 2600 market and concentrate on the new gaming fad Home Computers.  Activision did release a few new games during the 2600 revival years, but Thwocker was not one of them.  At this point Activision was concentrating on converting arcade games to the 2600 instead of releasing older unpublished games.  What they didn't realize is that the older games they were ignoring were much better than the new games they were putting out (but that's another story).  Thankfully Thwocker finally got its long overdue release, and now we can all enjoy what has to be one of the most unique 2600 games I've ever seen.","《击乐手》是一款和它的名字一样奇特的游戏。它由查理·希思（因《反应堆》而闻名）编写，曾被描述为“用乐器进行的《骑士决斗》”。虽然这个描述不算差，但它并不能完全展现出让《击乐手》成为一款有趣游戏的所有游戏元素。

你将操控一个小指挥家（看起来就像一个保龄球），他必须在迷宫中弹跳，为他的歌曲收集音符。一路上，你必须避开各种想要攻击你的乐器（难道我们就不能和平相处吗？）。然而，你不能随意抓取任何音符，你必须按照正确的顺序收集它们。当前需要的音符类型会显示在屏幕底部。如果你碰到了错误类型的音符，你会被反弹开，指挥家会被弹飞到屏幕的另一边（通常会撞到等待着的敌人）。收集完所有音符后，你必须抓取迷宫顶部的高音谱号符号来开始播放歌曲。一旦歌曲开始播放，你的角色就可以触碰敌人和音符来获得分数（可以把这想象成吃了能量豆），直到歌曲结束。完成歌曲后，你可以通过触碰出口方块来离开关卡。

《击乐手》的操作需要一点时间来适应，但它们并不像乍看起来那么难。关卡似乎是由某种有弹性的材料构成的，所以你的角色会在屏幕上四处弹跳。你可以通过上下按键来控制弹跳的高度。按下向下键会让指挥家小幅度弹跳，而在触地时按下向上键会让他跳得非常高。你可以通过按下射击键来停止弹跳，这会让指挥家在关卡中“滑行”。你需要掌握所有这些弹跳技巧才能成功完成关卡。

遗憾的是，《击乐手》并不完整，因为没有办法离开关卡。人们原以为玩家只需在完成歌曲后触碰出口方块就能结束关卡，但事实并非如此。似乎允许你在完成歌曲后消灭敌人的代码也会让你破坏出口，所以这个游戏看起来无法通关。然而，在仔细检查游戏代码后，似乎《击乐手》隐藏着更多不为人知的内容。显然，玩家必须在歌曲开始播放后以某种方式“融合”歌曲的两种声音才能离开关卡。不幸的是，我们还没有弄清楚游戏的这部分是如何运作的，但这可能与拾取屏幕上的某些物品有关。然而，仅仅因为存在离开关卡的代码并不意味着在游戏中实际能够做到这一点，所以《击乐手》可能终究还是无法通关。

值得庆幸的是，你仍然可以通过在标题屏幕上选择更高难度的级别来查看其他关卡。程序员查理·希思（拥有已知的唯一另一个原型）表示，在开发取消时，《击乐手》只完成了大约80%。人们不禁会想，查理原本还为我们准备了什么，因为除了无法完成关卡之外，《击乐手》似乎已经可以完全游玩且内容完整。也许还有一些小的游戏或难度问题有待解决？我在游戏中唯一看到的漏洞出现在游戏选择屏幕上。游戏编号应该从1到10，但在9和10之间有六个游戏。这些游戏编号分别用一个空格、另一个空格、一个白色八分音符、一个空格、一个白色四分音符和一个点来表示。这很可能是因为游戏编号是以十六进制（基数为16）存储的，所以代表了16个游戏。目前尚不清楚查理原本是打算制作16个游戏还是只有10个，但由于它们似乎都可以游玩，人们得出的结论是这些游戏确实是有计划的。

《击乐手》和《烤肉机》一样，都是1984年电子游戏市场崩溃的受害者。大约在这个时候，动视决定退出Atari 2600游戏机市场，转而专注于新兴的家用电脑游戏热潮。在Atari 2600复兴的那些年里，动视确实发布了几款新游戏，但《击乐手》并不在其中。那时，动视专注于将街机游戏移植到Atari 2600上，而不是发布那些未出版的老游戏。他们没有意识到，他们忽视的那些老游戏比他们推出的新游戏要好得多（但那又是另一个故事了）。值得庆幸的是，《击乐手》终于迎来了姗姗来迟的发布，现在我们都可以尽情享受这款我所见过的最独特的Atari 2600游戏之一。"

The joystick can be used to raise and lower the blinds by pushing up or down. When the blinds are raised a nicely done sunset is visible out the window.  
 
The story behind the Venetian Blind demo is rather interesting. As most people know, Activision was founded by several ex-Atari employees who had left due to Atari's policies on programmer recognition (or the lack thereof). One of these employees was Bob Whitehead, creator of the ""Venetian Blinds"" technique, which was first used in Atari's Video Chess to display eight objects in a row instead of the normal six. Even though Activision had never used the Venetian Blinds technique in any of their games, that didn't stop Atari from threatening to sue Activision for ""stealing"" the technique along with other various proprietary information.  
 
Since Activision knew that they hadn't stolen anything from Atari, they decided to play a little joke on Atari. According to David Crane, when the Atari's lawyers questioned them about the ""stolen"" Venetian Blinds technique David showed them this demo and said ""Is this what you guys are referring to?"". Apparently Atari wasnâ€™t in a laughing mood, and they went through with the lawsuit. In the end Atari ended up losing the case and Activision went on to become the most successful of the 2600 third party companies.  
 
Although Activision never made a game out of this demo it didn't go completely to waste. The sunset was later used in the background of Barnstorming.","顾名思义，“百叶窗”演示程序并非一款游戏，而是一个模拟一组百叶窗的演示程序！可以通过上下推动操纵杆来升降百叶窗。当百叶窗升起时，窗外可见一幅精美的日落景象。

“百叶窗”演示程序背后的故事相当有趣。众所周知，动视公司是由几位前雅达利员工创立的，他们因雅达利对待程序员认可方面的政策（或者说缺乏这种政策）而离职。其中一位员工是鲍勃·怀特黑德，他发明了“百叶窗”技术，该技术首次应用于雅达利的《视频国际象棋》中，用于一行显示八个对象，而非通常的六个。尽管动视从未在其任何游戏中使用过“百叶窗”技术，但这并未阻止雅达利威胁要起诉动视“窃取”该技术以及其他各种专有信息。

由于动视知道自己并未从雅达利窃取任何东西，他们决定和雅达利开个小玩笑。据大卫·克莱恩说，当雅达利的律师就“被盗”的“百叶窗”技术质问他们时，大卫给他们展示了这个演示程序，并说：“你们指的是这个吗？”显然雅达利没心情开玩笑，他们还是提起了诉讼。最终，雅达利败诉，而动视后来成为了雅达利2600游戏机最成功的第三方游戏公司。

尽管动视从未将这个演示程序做成一款游戏，但它也并非完全被浪费。后来，那幅日落景象被用在了《空中特技》的背景中。"

Wings an air combat simulation game similar to the Atari Lynx title War Birds.  Wings was originally intended to be a 4K game, but it was decided that trying to cram a complete flight simulator into a tiny 4K cartridge was too difficult.  Therefore Wings was shelved until the development of the RAM Plus chip (a 10.5K RAM chip) made it possible.  Wings was thought to exist as a prototype for many years, but wasn't discovered until late 2004.  It was originally assumed that Wings would use the Booster Grip controller for its complex controls, but when the prototype was finally found it was discovered that it supported not only the Booster Grip, but also a strange two joystick scheme instead (similar to the late Atari release Radar Lock). 
The Left Joystick 
The Left Joystick is used to control your plane.  Pressing the fire button and pushing up will throttle up the engines, while pressing the fire button and pushing down will throttle down the engines. 
The Right Joystick 
The Right Joystick is used to access your weapons.  Your weapon systems are only enabled after clearing the runway or reaching an altitude of 60 Feet.  Pushing down will switch between machine guns and missiles, while pressing up will fire your weapons.  Guns are weak, but have unlimited ammunition.  Missiles on the other hand are very powerful, but you only get two.  Use them wisely. 
Before diving into the gameplay, this would be a good time to discuss the the instrument panel as it is vital to your survival.  Your instrument panel contains four different gauges: Fuel, Power, Airspeed, and Altitude.  Each of these gauges uses a digital readout to display to keep your informed on how your plane is performing.   
    Fuel Gauge (FUEL) - Measures how much fuel you have remaining (duh!).  If your fuel drops below 1500 it will begin to beep and flash warning you that you are about run out of fuel and crash. 
    Power Gauge (PWR) - Measures the current power of your engines.  More power means more speed, but it also eats up more fuel. 
    Airspeed Gauge (ASPD) - Measures your current airspeed.  You must maintain an average airspeed of at least 1535 MPH or this gauge will begin to flash and beep.  If you exceed 8000 MPH your plane will fall apart. 
    Altitude Gauge (ALT) - Measures your current altitude.  You must maintain an altitude of at least 512 Feet or this gauge will begin to flash and beep. 
Also appearing on your instrument panel are three displays: 
    Radar (left) - Shows you where the enemy planes are. 
    Artificial Horizon (middle) - This gauge shows you how level your plane is. 
    Compass (right) - Shows the direction your plane is heading in. 
After a rousing rendition of Flight of Valkyries (which can be toggled on/off with the left difficulty switch), you start the game on the runway (naturally).  To take off you must throttle up your engines and achieve an airspeed of at least 512 MPH.  Once you've reached 512 MPH you can begin to lift the nose up (push down) and go airborne.  The runway will change colors (from Blue -> Gray -> Red -> Green/White) to help you tell how far away from the end you are.  Once you're in the air, things get a little more tricky.  You will need to maintain an average airspeed of at least 1535 MPH to remain airborne or your gauge will begin to flash and beep.  If your speed drops below 780 MPH you will begin to go into a nose-dive and eventually crash.  You will also need to keep an altitude of at least 512 Feet or the altitude gauge will begin to flash and beep warning you that you're too low to the ground. 
Keep in mind that the direction of your nose will change how the plane reacts.  If your nose is pointed upwards you will gain altitude, but will also lose speed.  Likewise if your nose is pointed downwards you will gain speed, but lose altitude.  Figuring out the proper positioning of your plane's nose is key to staying airborne.  If your plane is level you can keep the a constant speed and altitude by throttling the engines to around 500.  This will help keep everything under control while you're busy shooting down planes. 
Once you're flying a bit you will undoubtedly notice that you are not alone.  Enemy planes and ground guns will begin to take pot shots at you shortly after take off.  At first you may only see their bullets flying at you (represented by a spinning square), but if you get close enough you'll actually see the enemy themselves.  Thankfully your plane is armed with the latest in air to air combat weaponry.  To shoot your guns at the enemy planes, get one in your crosshairs and press up on the second controller.  You can also shoot missiles at the planes (press down on the second controller to switch to missiles), but you only get two so use them wisely.  Missiles are much more powerful than your machine guns, but should only be used in emergencies.  You can tell when you have your missiles armed by the targeting box that replaces your normal crosshairs. 
Wings isn't a bad game, but grows repetitive after while for those of us who don't absolutely love air combat games.  There just aren't enough enemies to keep the game interesting, as you can fly around for long periods of time without ever getting a blip on your radar.  Another issue is there there are no clouds in the sky nor objects on the ground to give you a sense of speed.  Apparently marketing wanted to add some clouds, but they never got implemented.  Wings is more complex than other 2600 air combat games like Air Raiders, but not so complex that it becomes a chore to keep your plane flying.  It appears that Stuart was able to strike the perfect balance between accurate flight sim and action oriented dog fighting.  Sadly CBS decided to pull the plug on Wings mere weeks before it was ready to be released when they closed down cartridge development on October 23rd 1983.  The decision was made so late that promotional material (hats and scarves) and even a commercial had been made. 
There are two different Wings prototypes known to exist.  The earlier version dated June 3rd is in NTSC format, but is missing the enemy planes making it pretty boring to play.  The later version dated October 10th has the enemy implemented, but is in PAL format (CBS may have been planing on making Wings a PAL only release towards the end).  Oddly enough Stuart doesn't remember working on a PAL version of Wings.","正如你可能从“战机”这个名字猜到的，这款游戏全围绕飞机展开。《战机》是一款空战模拟游戏，类似于雅达利Lynx平台的《战鸟》。《战机》最初打算做成一款4K游戏，但后来发现要把一个完整的飞行模拟器塞进小小的4K卡带里太难了。因此，《战机》被搁置了，直到RAM Plus芯片（一种10.5K的RAM芯片）的开发让它成为可能。多年来，人们一直以为《战机》只有一个原型，直到2004年末才被发现。最初人们认为《战机》会使用Booster Grip控制器来实现其复杂的操控，但当原型最终被找到时，人们发现它不仅支持Booster Grip，还支持一种奇怪的双摇杆操控方案（类似于雅达利后期发布的《雷达锁定》）。
左摇杆
左摇杆用于控制你的飞机。按下开火按钮并向上推，发动机会加速；按下开火按钮并向下推，发动机会减速。
右摇杆
右摇杆用于使用你的武器。只有在离开跑道或达到60英尺的高度后，你的武器系统才会启用。向下推可以在机枪和导弹之间切换，向上推则可以开火。机枪威力较弱，但弹药无限。另一方面，导弹非常强大，但你只有两枚，要明智地使用它们。
在开始游戏之前，现在是讨论仪表盘的好时机，因为它对你的生存至关重要。你的仪表盘包含四个不同的仪表：燃油、动力、空速和高度。每个仪表都使用数字读数来显示，让你了解飞机的运行状况。
    燃油表（FUEL） - 测量你剩余的燃油量（这还用说！）。如果你的燃油量降至1500以下，它会开始发出蜂鸣声并闪烁，警告你即将耗尽燃油并坠毁。
    动力表（PWR） - 测量你发动机的当前动力。动力越大，速度越快，但也会消耗更多的燃油。
    空速表（ASPD） - 测量你当前的空速。你必须保持平均至少1535英里每小时的空速，否则这个仪表会开始闪烁并发出蜂鸣声。如果你超过8000英里每小时，你的飞机会解体。
    高度表（ALT） - 测量你当前的高度。你必须保持至少512英尺的高度，否则这个仪表会开始闪烁并发出蜂鸣声。
你的仪表盘上还会出现三个显示屏：
    雷达（左） - 显示敌机的位置。
    人工地平线（中） - 这个仪表显示你的飞机的水平状态。
    罗盘（右） - 显示你的飞机的飞行方向。
在激昂地播放完《女武神的骑行》（可以用左难度开关打开/关闭）后，你自然是从跑道上开始游戏。要起飞，你必须加速发动机，达到至少512英里每小时的空速。一旦你达到512英里每小时，你就可以开始抬起机头（向下推）并起飞。跑道会改变颜色（从蓝色 -> 灰色 -> 红色 -> 绿色/白色），帮助你判断离跑道尽头还有多远。一旦你升空，事情就变得有点棘手了。你需要保持平均至少1535英里每小时的空速才能保持在空中，否则你的仪表会开始闪烁并发出蜂鸣声。如果你的速度降至780英里每小时以下，你会开始俯冲，最终坠毁。你还需要保持至少512英尺的高度，否则高度表会开始闪烁并发出蜂鸣声，警告你离地面太近了。
要记住，机头的方向会改变飞机的反应。如果你的机头向上，你会增加高度，但也会失去速度。同样，如果你的机头向下，你会增加速度，但会失去高度。找出飞机机头的正确位置是保持飞行的关键。如果你的飞机处于水平状态，你可以通过将发动机油门控制在500左右来保持恒定的速度和高度。这将帮助你在忙于击落敌机时控制好一切。
一旦你飞行了一会儿，你肯定会注意到你并不孤单。起飞后不久，敌机和地面火炮就会开始向你射击。起初，你可能只看到它们的子弹向你飞来（用一个旋转的方块表示），但如果你靠得足够近，你实际上会看到敌人本身。值得庆幸的是，你的飞机配备了最新的空空作战武器。要向敌机开枪，将一架敌机置于你的准星内，然后在第二个控制器上向上推。你也可以向敌机发射导弹（在第二个控制器上向下推切换到导弹），但你只有两枚，所以要明智地使用它们。导弹比你的机枪强大得多，但只应在紧急情况下使用。当你装备了导弹时，你可以通过取代正常准星的瞄准框来判断。
《战机》并不是一款糟糕的游戏，但对于我们这些并非绝对热爱空战游戏的人来说，玩一段时间后就会觉得重复。敌人数量不足以让游戏保持趣味性，因为你可以长时间飞行，雷达上都不会出现一个亮点。另一个问题是，天空中没有云，地面上也没有物体来让你感受到速度。显然，市场部门想添加一些云，但最终没有实现。《战机》比其他2600平台的空战游戏（如《空袭者》）更复杂，但又不至于复杂到让你难以让飞机保持飞行。看来斯图尔特成功地在精确的飞行模拟和以动作为导向的空战之间找到了完美的平衡。遗憾的是，哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）在1983年10月23日停止卡带开发时，在《战机》即将发布的前几周决定取消这个项目。这个决定做出得太晚了，宣传材料（帽子和围巾）甚至广告都已经制作好了。
已知存在两个不同的《战机》原型。较早的版本日期为6月3日，是NTSC格式，但没有敌机，玩起来相当无聊。较晚的版本日期为10月10日，加入了敌机，但采用PAL格式（CBS可能在最后打算将《战机》仅作为PAL格式发布）。奇怪的是，斯图尔特不记得自己参与过《战机》PAL版本的开发。"

5af874093e5efcbaeb4377b84c5f2ec5,Wizard (USA) (Proto).zip,Wizard,巫师,"If there was ever an obscure prototype it's Wizard.  Wizard was supposedly the last of Atari's last 2K games, but went unreleased in favor of the new 4K games.  Since Wizard was never advertised in any Atari catalogs and it was never assigned a part number, most people don't even know of its existence.
Wizard can best be described as a cross between Berzerk and Wizard of Wor.  You control a wizard (at least I think he's a wizard), who must attempt to destroy the swirling star shaped creature.  The board layout is a giant maze, which makes it hard to run from the creature and to get a clean shot off.  Unfortunately the creature can move through the maze walls, but thankfully it can't shoot through them.  Once you take a shot you'll notice that your wizard dims a bit, this means you are recharging, and cannot shoot.  Once your wizard is done recharging he will light back up again, and you can take another shot.  You don't have to worry about aiming you shots, as you will automatically shoot in the direction of the creature.  This makes it easy to run away but still take shots at the creature.
Your wizard starts out with zero damage (indicated by the right number), and will die if the damage counter reaches 99.  Each shot you take from the creature causes you two points of damage, touching the creature will also cause you two points of damage.  As you take more and more damage your wizard will weaken until he finally dies.  In your weakened state you will move slower and take longer to recharge.
The creatures damage counter is on the left side of the screen.  Each time you shoot the creature it will take two points so damage and be stunned for a few seconds.  This is your chance to get away to a safe distance and hide as you recharge.  The creature is normally invisible unless it's shooting at you or it has taken a hit.  You can tell where the creature is by listening to the ""heartbeat"" in the background.  The closer the creature, the louder the sound.
If you manage to get the creature's damage counter up to 99, it will turn black and die.  Your victory is short lived however as a new and more deadly creature will replace the old one.  Each new creature starts with less damage than the previous one, and moves and shoots much faster.  Each time you kill the creature your kill counter (next to the creatures damage counter) will go up by one, and your damage counter will go down significantly.
Wizard has a unique two player feature where one player can control the wizard while the other player controls the creature.  Since the creature is normally invisible, the second player must move blindly about the maze until he comes in range of the wizard.  The second player's creature will automatically fire at the player making his job slighty easier.  This interesting twist on the normal two player variation shows some innovation not seen in many games.
Hidden in a random part of the maze is a small glowing flame.  If the left difficulty switch is set to A then you Wizard has the added task of defending the flame.  If the creature touches the flame your wizard will slow down as his source of power has been captured.  On the easy setting the flame is invulnerable to the creature and doesn't have any affect on the game.
While Wizard may not look like much today, it's amazingly fun in short bursts.  Unfortunately by the time Wizard was ready to be released (1980), Atari was starting to make 4K games with better sounds and graphics than their 2K predecessors.  According to programmer Chris Crawford ""It didn't fit well into the product line"".  Wizard was simply too dated to be released as is, but probably could have been made into a decent 4K game had Atari wanted to take the time to retool it.  But as they say, time waits for no man.  Sadly Wizard was left in dust, destined only to become a footnote in prototype history.","如果说有什么鲜为人知的原型游戏，那就是《巫师》了。《巫师》据说是雅达利最后一批2K游戏中的最后一款，但为了推出新的4K游戏而未发布。由于《巫师》从未在任何雅达利产品目录中做过宣传，也从未被分配过产品编号，大多数人甚至都不知道它的存在。
《巫师》可以被最好地描述为《疯狂杀戮》（Berzerk）和《沃巫师》（Wizard of Wor）的结合体。你控制一名巫师（至少我认为他是巫师），他必须试图摧毁那个旋转的星形生物。游戏棋盘布局是一个巨大的迷宫，这使得你很难从该生物身边逃脱并进行干净利落的射击。不幸的是，该生物可以穿过迷宫的墙壁，但值得庆幸的是它不能穿墙射击。一旦你开了一枪，你会注意到你的巫师会稍微变暗，这意味着你正在重新充能，无法射击。一旦你的巫师充能完毕，他会再次变亮，你就可以再开一枪。你不必担心瞄准射击，因为你会自动朝着生物的方向射击。这使得你在逃跑的同时仍能向生物射击变得容易。
你的巫师初始伤害值为零（由右边的数字表示），如果伤害计数器达到99，他就会死亡。生物每次向你射击会使你受到两点伤害，碰到生物也会使你受到两点伤害。随着你受到越来越多的伤害，你的巫师会变弱，直到最终死亡。在你变弱的状态下，你移动会变慢，充能时间也会变长。
生物的伤害计数器在屏幕左侧。每次你射击生物，它会受到两点伤害，并会眩晕几秒钟。这是你趁机逃到安全距离并在充能时躲藏起来的机会。生物通常是隐形的，除非它在向你射击或受到了攻击。你可以通过听背景中的“心跳声”来判断生物的位置。生物离得越近，声音就越大。
如果你设法将生物的伤害计数器提升到99，它会变黑并死亡。然而，你的胜利是短暂的，因为一个新的、更致命的生物会取代旧的生物。每个新生物初始的伤害值都比前一个低，而且移动和射击速度都快得多。每次你杀死生物，你的杀敌计数器（在生物伤害计数器旁边）会加一，而你的伤害计数器会大幅下降。
《巫师》有一个独特的双人游戏功能，一名玩家可以控制巫师，而另一名玩家可以控制生物。由于生物通常是隐形的，第二名玩家必须在迷宫中盲目移动，直到进入巫师的射程范围内。第二名玩家控制的生物会自动向第一名玩家射击，这让他的任务稍微轻松一些。这种对普通双人游戏模式的有趣创新在很多游戏中都看不到。
在迷宫的某个随机位置隐藏着一小团发光的火焰。如果左边的难度开关设置为A，那么你的巫师就有额外的任务来保护火焰。如果生物碰到火焰，你的巫师会因为他的能量源被夺走而变慢。在简单难度设置下，火焰对生物是免疫的，并且对游戏没有任何影响。
虽然《巫师》在今天看来可能并不起眼，但短时间玩起来却出奇地有趣。不幸的是，当《巫师》准备发布时（1980年），雅达利开始制作4K游戏，其音效和画面都比他们的2K前辈更好。据程序员克里斯·克劳福德（Chris Crawford）说：“它不太适合产品线。” 《巫师》如果原样发布实在太过时了，但如果雅达利愿意花时间对其进行重新开发，它可能会成为一款不错的4K游戏。但俗话说，时光不等人。遗憾的是，《巫师》被尘封了，注定只能成为原型游戏历史中的一个脚注。"

At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible.
When the the player completes a maze, a Worluk sometimes appears. This creature moves rapidly and will only be on the screen momentarily.

Shooting a letter will make it appear in the space below your ship and is worth a point. You have space for 12 letters here adding each additional letter will remove one from the left hand side. Shooting any other object will cause you to lose a life, a point, and will remove the last letter added.

503d9aa88aeab356cbb16b824021703f,Xevious (USA) (Proto) (1983-08-02).zip,Xevious,宇宙巡航机,"It's dangerous, it's devious, it's Xevious.  Never before has a tag line so perfectly summed up a video game.  Xevious was one of the first (if not the first) in a new genre of arcade games: the scrolling shooter.  While we make take such games for granted today, back in 1982 such a concept was unheard of.  Most games of the time had only one non-scrolling screen, which seriously limited their creativity.  One screen shooter like Galaga and Galaxian were ok, but players hungered for something different.  Xevious satisfied that hunger.
It's a nightmare, but it's true.  Scientific research has determined that we are the actual aliens on Earth and the evil Xevions are the original inhabitants.  Now the Xevions want Earth back, minus the humans! Earth's last hope is an experimental fighter plane known as the Solvalou.  The mission is dangerous, success isn't guaranteed, and odds are this is a one-way trip.  But at this point it's do or die!
As Earth's last hope, you must successfully defeat the Xevion assault fleet before they reclaim earth.  However this won't be an easy task, the Xevions have had over a millennia to develop the biggest, nastiest, and most destructive ships Earth has ever seen.  Thankfully the Solvalou is armed with the latest in weapons technology which will cut through the Xevion hordes like a hot knife through butter.  The Solvalou has two main weapons, a laser blaster for taking out air targets, and a photon bomber for destroying ground targets.  Over the course of the game you'll run into numerous enemy types which can only be destroyed using the appropriate weapon, so mastering the dual shot (air and ground) technique is vital.
Toroid Fleet Ships -- These round rotating objects are the first and most common enemy encountered in Xevious.  Gliding in from the left or right, a small squad of Toroids come towards your ship before darting away from whence they came.  Thankfully Toroids don't pose much of a threat unless you happen to be distracted by something else at the time.
Torkan Scout Ships -- Torkan Scouts are similar to Toroids except if they see your ship they will change color and fire.  They also have a bad tendency to ram your ship.
Jarra Spinners -- Jarra Spinners tend to move faster than Torkan Scout Ships, but they also move in a more straight forward pattern.   As the name implies they appear to be spinning as they move.
Mirrors (Bacura Shields) -- Mirrors are the single most annoying enemy in Xevious.  These large rotating squares appear in large swarms at various points in the game.  Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but they are INDESTRUCTABLE!  That's right, all you can do is avoid them and hope one doesn't go smashing into your cockpit.  Thankfully Mirror swarms are fairly uncommon.
Zoshi Death Squad -- These odd shaped UFO's are encountered in the later areas.  As the name suggests, Zoshi Death Squads are quick and deadly.  Take great care when attempting to engage themnnGiddo Spario -- These tiny balls of energy are quick and hard to see.  Unless you're careful these will wipe your ship out in no time.
Zakato Energy Launcher -- Zakato Energy Launchers (also known as Black Balls) are on of the deadliest enemies in Xevious.  Appearing out of nowhere, Black Balls self-destruct into a fast moving bullet which will then launch itself at you.  While one or two are easy to avoid, Black Balls like to swarm and appear right next to your ship making them all the more deadly.  Black Balls tend to herald the arrival of Andor Genesis, so when they start to appear you know Andor isn't far behind.
Andor Genesis -- This is the big one, the Mother Ship!  Andor Genesis is a hulking air fortress armed with four laser cannons just dying to blow you out of the sky.  The only way to defeat Andor Genesis is with a direct hit on the rector core with a photon bomb (think Star Wars), however getting close enough to Andor Genesis without being hit is a major challenge.  Destroying the rector will cause Andor Genesis will cause it to flee and prepare itself for another attack.
Domogram Rovers -- As the name implies Rovers spend their days roaming along the ground just taking pot shots at your ship.  Rovers move quite fast and can be difficult to bombnnLogram Sphere Station -- These sphere shaped structures appear to be harmless although they will occasionally shoot a bullet towards your ship.  Be on your guard.
Derota Defense Station -- These square pyramid shaped structures are the most common defensive structure that you'll encounter.  Derota Defense Stations will often shoot a quick moving energy bullet at your ship.  Take them out quickly before they become a problem.
Batra Energy Station -- These square pyramid shaped structures provide power for the Xevion assault fleet.  They'll take pot shots at you if you get too close.
When Ray Kassar was fired as CEO of Atari in 1983, James Morgan was hired to take his place.  Jim put all projects on hold for 30 days while he reviewed what had been going on during Ray's ""reign of terror"".  Since the 7800 was deemed high priority, most 2600 and 5200 projects were put on hold or outsourced to GCC.  It was originally assumed that Xevious was one of the 2600 titles that were killed off during this time, but recently a nearly complete version of the game was found proving that it survived at least until early 1984.
While the gameplay in the 2600 version is amazingly accurate, some corners still had to be cut.  One of the 2600's biggest problem was that it only had one fire button, making many arcade conversions difficult.  Tod got around this problem by having the fire button serve double duty as your fire and bomb button.  Pressing the fire will shoot a shot and drop a bomb that slowly arcs to where the targeting sight is.  The enemy AI also got a bit of a lobotomy so they all generally act the same instead of having distinct attack patterns.  Amazingly Tod was able to implement a scrolling background as was seen in the arcade version.  While this background wasn't as detailed as it's arcade cousin, it was still a major accomplishment for the 2600.  Not only was Tod able to get the scrolling background implemented, but he was able to have multiple enemies appear on the screen at once with little or no flicker.  In fact the only thing that flickers in the entire game is your ship which is actually made up of two missile graphics to keep more sprites free (hence the funny shape and flickering).  This odd design also makes your ship almost twice as large as it was in the arcade (making it harder to dodge enemy shots).
Although Xevious appears to be just about complete, there are a few bugs still present in the code.  The 2600 version of Xevious has an option for controlling the scrolling speed with the difficulty switches (a feature not found in any other version).  However when the game is put in fast mode (A=Slow, B=Fast) the scrolling gets rather choppy and non-uniform making it hard to play after a while.   There's also a glitch in one of the animation frames of the boss (Andor Genesis) due to the game accidentally reading sound code rather than graphics code.  Scoring seems to be a bit generous in this version making it easy to rack up extra lives, but it is unknown if this would have been changed before release.  The code is also unoptimized which wastes a lot of space that could have been used for other improvements, however since code optimization is one of the last things that is done to a game before completion this is not unexpected.
Unfortunately as good as Xevious was, it didn't stand a chance against the deadliest of enemies ?collapsing market'.   The 2600 version along with the 5200 version were canceled with the 7800 version being the only one to see the light of day.  This is a shame because it's obvious that Tod was a highly skilled programmer who could push the 2600 to its limits and Xevious is an amazing looking game.  The remaining bugs could have probably been squashed with just a few more weeks of work with code optimization taking a little longer.  Had it been finished Xevious probably would have been a mainstay in the 2600 library and a big hit, but it appears that Atari wasn't willing to wait.","它充满危险，它诡计多端，它就是《宇宙巡航机》。此前从未有一句宣传语能如此完美地概括一款电子游戏。《宇宙巡航机》是新型街机游戏类型——卷轴射击游戏的先驱之一（如果不是第一个的话）。如今我们可能认为这类游戏理所当然，但在1982年，这样的概念闻所未闻。当时大多数游戏只有一个非卷轴屏幕，这严重限制了它们的创意。像《小蜜蜂》和《太空侵略者》这样的单屏射击游戏还不错，但玩家渴望一些不同的东西。《宇宙巡航机》满足了这种渴望。

这是一场噩梦，但却是真的。科学研究表明，我们才是地球上真正的外星人，而邪恶的塞维恩星人（Xevions）才是地球的原住民。现在塞维恩星人想夺回地球，除掉人类！地球的最后希望是一架名为索尔瓦鲁（Solvalou）的实验战斗机。任务危险重重，成功并无保证，而且很可能是有去无回。但在这个节骨眼上，只能背水一战！

作为地球的最后希望，你必须在塞维恩星人夺回地球之前成功击败他们的攻击舰队。然而，这绝非易事，塞维恩星人经过了上千年的发展，拥有地球前所未见的最大、最邪恶、最具破坏力的战舰。所幸的是，索尔瓦鲁配备了最先进的武器技术，能像热刀切黄油一样穿透塞维恩星人的成群战舰。索尔瓦鲁有两种主要武器，一种是用于击落空中目标的激光炮，另一种是用于摧毁地面目标的光子炸弹。在游戏过程中，你会遇到众多类型的敌人，有些敌人只能用相应的武器才能摧毁，因此掌握双射击（空中和地面）技术至关重要。

环形舰队战舰——这些圆形旋转物体是《宇宙巡航机》中最先遇到且最常见的敌人。一小队环形战舰从左或右滑行而来，朝着你的飞船飞来，然后又迅速飞离。所幸的是，除非你当时恰好被其他事情分心，否则环形战舰不会构成太大威胁。

托坎侦察舰——托坎侦察舰与环形战舰类似，但如果它们发现你的飞船，就会改变颜色并开火。它们还有撞向你飞船的坏习惯。

贾拉旋转器——贾拉旋转器的移动速度往往比托坎侦察舰快，但它们的移动模式更直接。顾名思义，它们在移动时看起来像是在旋转。

镜子（巴库拉护盾）——镜子是《宇宙巡航机》中最烦人的敌人。这些大型旋转方块在游戏的不同阶段会大量出现。通常这不会是个问题，但它们是无法摧毁的！没错，你所能做的就是避开它们，祈祷不要有一个撞到你的驾驶舱。所幸的是，镜子群并不常见。

佐希敢死队——这些形状怪异的不明飞行物会在游戏后期出现。顾名思义，佐希敢死队速度快且致命。与它们交战时要格外小心。

吉多·斯帕里奥——这些微小的能量球速度快且难以察觉。除非你小心应对，否则它们很快就会把你的飞船摧毁。

扎卡托能量发射器——扎卡托能量发射器（也被称为黑球）是《宇宙巡航机》中最致命的敌人之一。黑球会突然出现，然后自爆成一颗快速移动的子弹，向你射来。虽然一两个黑球很容易避开，但它们喜欢成群出现，而且会出现在你飞船旁边，这就更加致命了。黑球往往预示着安多·创世纪号的到来，所以当它们开始出现时，你就知道安多号不远了。

安多·创世纪号——这可是个大家伙，是母舰！安多·创世纪号是一座巨大的空中堡垒，配备四门激光炮，一心想把你从天空中轰下来。击败安多·创世纪号的唯一方法是用光子炸弹直接命中其反应堆核心（想想《星球大战》），然而，在不被击中的情况下接近安多·创世纪号是一项重大挑战。摧毁反应堆会使安多·创世纪号逃离并准备再次攻击。

多米格拉姆漫游者——顾名思义，漫游者整天在地面上四处游荡，向你的飞船随意射击。漫游者移动速度相当快，很难用炸弹击中它们。

洛格拉姆球形空间站——这些球形结构看起来无害，但它们偶尔会向你的飞船发射一颗子弹。要保持警惕。

德洛塔防御站——这些方形金字塔形状的结构是你最常遇到的防御工事。德洛塔防御站经常会向你的飞船发射一颗快速移动的能量子弹。在它们成为麻烦之前，尽快将它们消灭。

巴特拉能源站——这些方形金字塔形状的结构为塞维恩星人攻击舰队提供动力。如果你靠得太近，它们会向你随意射击。

1983年，雷·卡萨被解雇，不再担任雅达利公司首席执行官，詹姆斯·摩根受聘接任。吉姆暂停了所有项目30天，以便审查雷“恐怖统治”期间的情况。由于7800游戏机项目被视为重中之重，大多数2600和5200游戏机项目被暂停或外包给GCC公司。最初人们认为《宇宙巡航机》是这一时期被搁置的2600游戏之一，但最近发现了一个几乎完整的版本，证明它至少存活到了1984年初。

尽管2600版本的游戏玩法惊人地准确，但还是不得不做出一些妥协。2600游戏机最大的问题之一是它只有一个射击按钮，这使得许多街机游戏的移植变得困难。托德通过让射击按钮兼具射击和投弹功能解决了这个问题。按下射击按钮会发射一颗子弹，并投下一颗炸弹，炸弹会缓慢弧线飞向瞄准镜所在的位置。敌人的人工智能也被简化了，所以它们的行为大致相同，而不是有独特的攻击模式。令人惊讶的是，托德能够实现像街机版那样的滚动背景。虽然这个背景不如街机版详细，但对于2600游戏机来说，这仍然是一项重大成就。托德不仅实现了滚动背景，还能让多个敌人同时出现在屏幕上，几乎没有闪烁。事实上，整个游戏中唯一闪烁的是你的飞船，它实际上是由两个导弹图形组成的，这样可以腾出更多的精灵（因此形状怪异且闪烁）。这种奇特的设计也使你的飞船几乎比街机版大了一倍（更难躲避敌人的射击）。

尽管《宇宙巡航机》看起来几乎完成了，但代码中仍存在一些漏洞。2600版本的《宇宙巡航机》可以通过难度开关控制滚动速度（这是其他版本中没有的功能）。然而，当游戏设置为快速模式（A=慢，B=快）时，滚动会变得相当不流畅且不均匀，玩一会儿就会觉得很难操作。此外，由于游戏意外读取了声音代码而不是图形代码，导致 boss（安多·创世纪号）的一个动画帧出现了故障。这个版本的得分似乎有点宽松，很容易获得额外的生命，但不清楚在发布前是否会改变这一点。代码也没有进行优化，浪费了很多本可用于其他改进的空间，不过由于代码优化是游戏完成前最后要做的事情之一，所以这并不意外。

不幸的是，尽管《宇宙巡航机》很不错，但它在面对最致命的敌人——“市场崩溃”时，毫无胜算。2600版本和5200版本被取消，只有7800版本得以问世。这很可惜，因为很明显托德是一位技艺高超的程序员，他能将2600游戏机的性能发挥到极致，而且《宇宙巡航机》是一款画面惊人的游戏。剩下的漏洞可能只需再花几周时间就能修复，代码优化则需要更长时间。如果它能完成，《宇宙巡航机》可能会成为2600游戏库中的经典之作并大受欢迎，但看来雅达利不愿意等待。"
