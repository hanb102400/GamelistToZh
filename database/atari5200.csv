玩家必须通过按下控制器按钮，用魔杖向靠近的昆虫发射火花来得分。按住控制器按钮，魔杖将进入连射模式。如果玩家被昆虫咬伤，将会暂时瘫痪，并失去初始三根魔杖中的一根。
昆虫对手与蘑菇
所有敌方昆虫在攻击前都会发出独特的声音，这或许能帮助玩家识别是哪种昆虫在发动攻击。游戏中的敌人和物体如下：
1. 蜈蚣
蜈蚣会发动12波攻击。在第一波攻击中，蜈蚣由1个头和11个身体节段组成。在第二波攻击中，蜈蚣除了一个独立的头外，还由1个头和10个身体节段组成。第三波攻击中，蜈蚣有1个头、9个身体节段，外加两个独立的头。这些身体节段会变成头，如此循环，直到第12波。在最后一波攻击中，蜈蚣会有12个独立的头，各自独立地攻击玩家。蜈蚣的头比身体节段得分更高。
蜈蚣会从屏幕顶部向下发动攻击。如果火花击中蜈蚣的任何部位，该身体节段会变成蘑菇，而它后面的身体节段会成为新的蜈蚣头。当蜈蚣被消灭后，它会短暂消失，然后再次从屏幕顶部出现。
2. 蜘蛛
蜘蛛会试图分散玩家对蜈蚣的攻击注意力。它会摧毁它碰到的任何蘑菇。如果在较近的距离击中蜘蛛，得分会更高。
3. 跳蚤
如果玩家摧毁了大部分现有的蘑菇，跳蚤就会出现。它会掉落并在落点处生成一批新的蘑菇。跳蚤被击中两次后会消失。第一次被击中后，跳蚤掉落的速度会快很多。
4. 蝎子
蝎子会在第三波攻击中出现。它移动缓慢，但会逐渐加速，移动得越来越快。在此过程中，它会毒化它碰到的任何蘑菇。
5. 蘑菇
蘑菇遍布魔法森林，它们可以作为玩家的障碍物或掩护，同时对敌方昆虫有额外的影响。需要射击四次才能完全摧毁一个蘑菇。蘑菇有两种类型：魔法蘑菇和毒蘑菇。魔法蘑菇是游戏中的默认蘑菇，也是玩家消灭昆虫或蜈蚣身体节段的结果。毒蘑菇是蝎子碰到蘑菇后的产物。毒蘑菇会促使附近的蜈蚣径直穿过任何蘑菇向玩家移动。失去一根魔杖会修复任何部分受损的蘑菇。
游戏难度与模式
游戏提供四种难度级别：新手、标准、高级和专家。游戏模式如下：
1. 单人模式
2. 双人交替模式
当当前玩家被咬伤时，两名玩家将轮流进行游戏。
3. 双人竞争模式
两名玩家将同时出现在屏幕上。得分是分开计算的。一名玩家发射的子弹会使另一名玩家瘫痪。
4. 团队合作模式
两名玩家将同时出现在屏幕上。得分是累计计算的。一名玩家发射的子弹不会使另一名玩家瘫痪。
得分规则
玩家每获得12000分将赢得一根额外的魔法魔杖，最多可拥有六根魔杖。当所有魔杖都用完时，游戏结束。得分规则如下：
蜈蚣头 - 100分
蜈蚣身体节段 - 10分
近距离击中蜘蛛 - 900分
中距离击中蜘蛛 - 600分

The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game.

At the start of each level a birdseed truck will weave its way through the maze dropping off piles of birdseed as it goes.  The goal of Roadrunner is to move the tiles around so Wiley Coyote eats as much birdseed as he can before the Roadrunner gets it.  Each tile contains a portion of the road which Wiley and the Roadrunner walk on, by sliding the tiles around you can make paths leading to the piles of birdseed or to the tunnels on the side of the board.  The tunnels connect one side of the screen to the other, and can be useful for warping across the screen.  Unfortunately some of these tunnel entrances are really just painted on, so if Wiley attempts to enter one he'll knock himself out.  The only way to tell if a tunnel is real is to watch the Roadrunner and see which tunnels he takes. 
 
Wiley can die if he either runs off the end of the tile or runs into a false tunnel.  The Roadrunner appears to be able to back up from dead end track pieces and tunnels so he is impossible to kill, but you can trap him on two dead end pieces and complete the level at your leisure.  Once all the birdseed is gone the game moves to the next level.  If you happen to run into the Roadrunner you will score 10 points, and you the Roadrunner will be transported back to your starting points.  Wiley also scores 35 points for each tile he crosses, and 50 points for each pile of birdseed he collects.

The Marathon Dive is a game in which you must guide Goofy up a series of platforms so he can reach the diving platform and jump off before the timer runs out.  As Goofy climbs up the platforms he must avoid little armored tanks, which will chase Goofy around.  Thankfully these tanks can't jump, reverse direction, or use the ladders, so they can be avoided by jumping over them or leading them into a hole (which will cause them to fall down to the next level).  Also hindering Goofy's progress are large gaps in the platforms which must be carefully jumped over.  If Goofy falls through a hole he'll fall down one level but is otherwise unharmed, however if he is hit by a tank he'll loose a life. 
  
If Goofy makes it to the top of the platform he will run off the end, making it about halfway across the screen before realizing that he's running in mid-air.  Now Goofy will begin to fall, and you must guide him down to the little floating platform below.  However the floating platform is constantly moving in an erratic fashion, so hitting it can be tough.  If you successfully reach the platform, Goofy will smash into it and have his parachute open a second too late (in typical cartoon fashion).  If you miss the platform Goofy will fall into the water and drown (I guess he doesn't know how to swim).  As the levels progress the tanks will begin to move faster and faster, the diving platform has more holes in it, and the floating platform moves more erratically.  Eventually the difficulty will wrap around however, and the game will get very easy again. 
 
Pogo Pop takes place on a series of squares where Goofy bounces up and down on a pogo stick in an effort to touch every tile.  This may sound easy but there's a catch, every time you jump one of the tiles disappears, so the tile that was below you may not be there when you land.  As the levels progress the frequency of the tiles disappearing increases, making it harder and harder not to fall through the floor.   
  
While you're jumping on tiles you can attempt to pop the Mickey Mouse balloons floating above you for extra points.  The balloons come in several different colors and are worth a varying amount of points.","这是一款未发布的雅达利5200游戏机原型游戏。你将操控高飞参加两项赛事：马拉松跳水和弹簧单高跷跳跃。

马拉松跳水是这样一款游戏：你必须引导高飞爬上一系列平台，以便他能在计时器归零前到达跳水台并跳下。当高飞爬上平台时，他必须避开小装甲坦克，这些坦克会追着高飞跑。好在这些坦克不会跳跃、改变方向或使用梯子，所以可以通过跳过它们或将它们引到洞里（这会让它们掉到下一层）来避开它们。阻碍高飞前进的还有平台上的大缺口，必须小心地跳过去。如果高飞掉进洞里，他会掉到下一层，但不会受到其他伤害；然而，如果他被坦克撞到，就会失去一条命。

如果高飞到达平台顶部，他会从末端跑出去，在意识到自己在半空中奔跑之前，他会跑到屏幕大约一半的位置。此时高飞会开始下落，你必须引导他落到下方的小浮动平台上。然而，浮动平台一直在不规则地移动，所以要跳到上面并不容易。如果你成功到达平台，高飞会猛地撞到上面，并且他的降落伞会晚一秒打开（就像典型的卡通情节那样）。如果你没跳到平台上，高飞会掉进水里淹死（我猜他不会游泳）。随着关卡推进，坦克会移动得越来越快，跳水台上的洞会更多，浮动平台的移动也会更不规则。不过，最终难度会循环回来，游戏会再次变得非常简单。

弹簧单高跷跳跃发生在一系列方块上，高飞用弹簧单高跷上下弹跳，试图触碰每一块地砖。这听起来可能很简单，但有个问题，每次你跳跃时，其中一块地砖就会消失，所以你起跳时下面的地砖在你落地时可能就不在了。随着关卡推进，地砖消失的频率会增加，这使得不掉进地板变得越来越难。

当你在地砖上跳跃时，你可以尝试戳破漂浮在你上方的米老鼠气球以获得额外分数。气球有几种不同的颜色，对应的分数也不同。"

Thankfully the Solvalou is armed with the latest in weapons technology which will cut through the Xevion hordes like a hot knife through butter.  The Solvalou has two main weapons, a laser blaster for taking out air targets, and a photon bomber for destroying ground targets.  Over the course of the game you'll run into numerous enemy types which can only be destroyed using the appropriate weapon, so mastering the dual shot (air and ground) technique is vital.","一款基于南梦宫热门射击游戏的未发行原型游戏。

这是一场噩梦，但却是真的。科学研究表明，我们人类才是地球上真正的外星人，而邪恶的塞维恩人才是地球的原住民。现在，塞维恩人想要夺回地球——把人类清除掉！地球的最后希望是一架名为索尔瓦鲁的实验战斗机。这项任务十分危险，成功并无保证，而且很可能是有去无回。但在这个节骨眼上，只能背水一战！

作为地球的最后希望，你必须在塞维恩侵略舰队夺回地球之前，成功击败他们。然而，这绝非易事，塞维恩人经过了上千年的发展，拥有地球上有史以来最大、最邪恶、最具破坏力的战舰。好在索尔瓦鲁配备了最先进的武器技术，对付塞维恩的乌合之众就像热刀割黄油一样轻松。索尔瓦鲁有两种主要武器，一种是用于击落空中目标的激光炮，另一种是用于摧毁地面目标的光子轰炸机。在游戏过程中，你会遇到各种各样的敌人，有些敌人只能用相应的武器才能摧毁，因此掌握双射（空中和地面）技巧至关重要。"

The Beatles yellow submarine graphic was not used in any Atari 5200 video game and was perhaps nothing more than an inspiration by the original programmer. There is no game here only the ability to control the yellow submarine on and around the screen,《黄色潜水艇》是一位不知名的雅达利程序员编写的一个原型程序，用于展示方向控制以及从屏幕一侧移出并在另一侧重新出现的功能。披头士乐队的黄色潜水艇图形并未在任何雅达利5200视频游戏中使用，它可能只是最初程序员的一个灵感来源。这里没有真正的游戏，只有在屏幕上及周围控制黄色潜水艇的功能。
c30bf5492ce0b77c8e2455ae2777daa6,Zaxxon (USA).zip,Zaxxon,太空战机,"The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up which was originally hugely successful in the arcades. The game has 3 stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.
Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, with the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are 3 distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.","在这款等轴视角的射击游戏中，你必须摧毁扎克隆防御系统。这款游戏最初在街机上取得了巨大成功。游戏共有3个阶段，首先你将穿越小行星城，这里有大量飞机、枪炮和导弹严密防守。许多障碍物都设有警报装置，留给你前进的空间有限，而且你必须时刻躲避火力攻击。
第二阶段是在太空中与成群的敌机展开激战——这些敌机是你在第一阶段未能摧毁的。完成这一阶段后，你将迎来与扎克隆的最终决战。如果你首次成功通关，游戏将循环进行，难度也会增加。游戏有3种不同的难度级别，操作方式类似飞行模拟游戏，向前操作可俯冲，向后操作则爬升。"

The goal is to turn the entire maze green by connecting each section of the maze to the source at the center of the screen. After all sections of the maze have been connected, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to having a time limit to complete your task, you need to avoid the flames and sparks which wander about the maze. From time to time a number will appear in a maze section and count down from 9 to 0. If you touch the number before it disappears, bonus points are earned. As the levels progress, the mazes become larger, trickier and more flames will appear.",《禅机》是一款动作/策略游戏，在游戏中你要操控一张滚动的脸穿越迷宫。迷宫的每个部分都可以通过这张脸进行旋转。游戏目标是将迷宫的每个部分与屏幕中央的源头相连，使整个迷宫变为绿色。在迷宫的所有部分都连接好后，你就可以进入下一个更具挑战性的关卡。除了完成任务有时间限制外，你还需要避开在迷宫中四处移动的火焰和火花。时不时地，迷宫的某个部分会出现一个数字，并从9倒计时到0。如果你在数字消失前触碰它，就能获得额外积分。随着关卡推进，迷宫会变得更大、更复杂，出现的火焰也会更多。
a1198d1f60a708a015563293bccf0922,Zone Ranger (USA).zip,Zone Ranger,区域游侠,"Zone Ranger is an arcade action game somewhat similar to Asteroids. You are the pilot of a spaceship in a deadly region of space. Large killer rocks, rogue satellites, boomerangs, and more all fill this region of space. Using your ships lasers you need to destroy as many of these as you can to earn points. Each level also contains some warp holes; enter one of these and you will be transported to a new location, which could be useful if you get in trouble. You will also occasionally come across some sonic sparklers; touch one of these, and you will temporarily become invincible. Another oddity you may come across is a super portal, which will transport you to the inner sanctum where bonus dots can be found. Lastly, on level one only a warp to the seventh dimension can be found. Lots of points can be earned there, but it's quite difficult so if you take this warp you probably won't last long!",《区域游侠》是一款街机动作游戏，有点类似于《小行星》。你是一艘宇宙飞船的飞行员，身处太空中的一个危险区域。这个区域布满了巨大的致命岩石、失控的卫星、回旋镖等等。你需要用飞船上的激光尽可能多地摧毁这些物体来赚取积分。每个关卡还设有一些传送门；进入其中一个传送门，你将被传送到一个新的地点，如果你陷入困境，这可能会很有用。你偶尔还会遇到一些音波闪光体；触碰其中一个，你将暂时无敌。你可能遇到的另一个奇特事物是超级传送门，它会把你传送到内殿，在那里可以找到奖励点。最后，只有在第一关才能找到通往第七维度的传送门。在那里可以获得大量积分，但难度相当大，所以如果你选择通过这个传送门，可能坚持不了多久！
